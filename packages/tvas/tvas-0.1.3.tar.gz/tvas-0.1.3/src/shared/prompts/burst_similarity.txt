Look at these two photos. Do they belong to the same set of burst shots?
They should be considered the same burst if:
1. They show the same subject in the same location.
2. They are visually very similar.

Answer with a JSON object: 
{
    "same_burst": true,
    "keyword": "short_keyword_describing_subject"
} 
or 
{
    "same_burst": false
}
