Release Notes
=============

Development - |version|
-----------------------
.. *Release Date: MMM. DD, YYYY*
* Allow communication to be one-way. Adds a :class:`~bsk_rl.act.Broadcast` action
  that can be used with :class:`~bsk_rl.comm.BroadcastCommunication` to only communicate
  data when the action has been called.
* Add example script for shielded training with action replacement and action masking in `Shielded training with action masking and action replacement <examples/training_with_shield.ipynb>`_.
* Add ``bsk`` as a dependency in ``pyproject.toml``.
* Update the CI/CD workflows to build BSK-RL using the new ``bsk`` dependency.
* Optimize performance of AEOS environments, especially for high request counts.
* Allow for the Vizard output path to be specified as a .bin file instead of just a directory.
* Use Vizard 2.3.1 locations for visualization; results in significantly smaller output
  files.
* Allow for a simpler Earth model to be used in Vizard by setting ``use_simple_earth=True``
  in the Vizard settings dictionary. This is helpful for when visualizing may Earth-fixed
  targets.
* Allow flight software and dynamics models to be specified as lists of classes. This allows
  for multiple inheritance to be used for easily creating more complex satellite models.
* The inheritance structure of flight software and dynamics models has changed. Most models
  now inherit from :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.fsw.FSWModel` or :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.dyn.DynModel`, 
  which are instantiable versions of the abstract bases :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.fsw.FSWModelABC` and
  :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.dyn.DynModelABC`, instead of from :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.fsw.BasicFSWModel` 
  or :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.dyn.BasicDynModel`. These are lighter-weight base classes that lack
  some functionality that was not always wanted.

  .. warning::

    If your custom satellite configurations break as a result of this change, add 
    :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.fsw.BasicFSWModel` and :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.dyn.BasicDynModel`
    to your ``fsw_type`` and ``dyn_type`` lists in your satellite classes.

* :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.fsw.FSWModel` implements direct actuator-less attitude control.
  By inheriting from a FSW class that overrides the ``MRPControlTask``, such as
  :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.fsw.BasicFSWModel` or :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.fsw.SteeringFSWModel`,
  users can implement custom attitude control strategies.
* Add a continuous action for setting attitude in :class:`~bsk_rl.act.AttitudeSetpoint`.

Version 1.2.0
-------------
*Release Date: Jul. 23, 2025*

* Add an example script where reward is based on the probability of successfully observing targets covered 
  by clouds in the `Cloud Environment with Re-imaging <examples/cloud_environment_with_reimaging.ipynb>`_ example.
* Add a conjunction checking dynamics model in :class:`ConjunctionDynModel`.
* Add utilities for relative motion state setup, :class:`~bsk_rl.utils.orbital.cd2hill`, :class:`~bsk_rl.utils.orbital.hill2cd`,
  and :class:`~bsk_rl.utils.orbital.relative_to_chief`.
* Add a ``dtype`` argument to the environment (or individual satellites) and sets the default
  dtype to ``np.float64``.
* Add support for continuous action spaces (e.g. for control problems) with :class:`~bsk_rl.act.ContinuousAction`.
* Add models and action for impulsive thrust and drift with a continuous action space (:class:`~bsk_rl.act.ImpulsiveThrust`).
* Changed inconsistent uses of ``datastore`` to ``data_store``.
* Added property ``data_store_kwargs`` to :class:`~bsk_rl.data.GlobalReward` that is unpacked in the
  :class:`DataStore` constructor.
* Implemented :class:`~bsk_rl.data.ResourceReward` to reward based on the level of a property in the satellite
  multiplied by some coefficient.
* Allow rewarders to mark a satellite as truncated or terminated with the ``is_truncated`` and ``is_terminated``
  methods.
* Added example script for using curriculum learning with RLlib in
  `Curriculum Learning <examples/curriculum_learning.ipynb>`_ example.
* Updated the list of `publications <publications.rst>`_
* Added the option to compute value with sMDP rewards at the start of the step in the
  RLlib configuration.
* Add the ability to observe remaining time in :class:`~bsk_rl.obs.Time`.
* Allow for the ``time_limit`` to be randomized.
* Added observation for arbitrary relative states between two satellites in :class:`~bsk_rl.obs.RelativeProperties`.
* Allow for the ``transmitterPacketSize`` to be specified. The default sets it to the instrument's baud rate.
* Add a maximum range checking dynamics model in :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.dyn.MaxRangeDynModel`. Useful for keeping an agent
  in the vicinity of a target early in training.
* Add properties in spacecraft dynamics for orbital element observations.
* Fix an issue with failure penalties in the PettingZoo environment when the rewarder
  does not return a reward for a satellite.
* Allow for per-episode randomization of :class:`~bsk_rl.data.ResourceReward` weights and observation
  of those weights with :class:`~bsk_rl.obs.ResourceRewardWeight`.
* Add :class:`~bsk_rl.act.ImpulsiveThrustHill` for impulsive thrust in the Hill frame.
* Separate :class:`~bsk_rl.utils.orbital.random_circular_orbit` and :class:`~bsk_rl.utils.orbital.random_orbit` to avoid misleading
  altitude argument.
* Add fault modeling example script using four reaction wheels in the `Fault Environment <examples/fault_environment.ipynb>`_ example.
* Introduce a new RSO inspection environment, primarily consisting of :class:`~bsk_rl.data.RSOInspectionReward`,
  :class:`~bsk_rl.scene.RSOPoints`, :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.fsw.RSOInspectorFSWModel`, and
  :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.dyn.RSODynModel`. An example environment setup is described in the
  `RSO Inspection <examples/rso_inspection.ipynb>`_ example.
* Add a maximum duration option to :class:`~bsk_rl.act.Image`.
* Fix a bug where a satellite's initial data was never added to the rewarder.
* Fix a bug where using multiple of the same rewarder would cause some settings to be 
  overwritten.
* Add the ability to define metaagents that concatenate satellite action and observation
  spaces in the environment.
* Add the ability to have the chief also terminate if a deputy violates a maximum range
  constraint in :class:`~bsk_rl.sim.dyn.MaxRangeDynModel`.


Version 1.1.0
-------------
*Release Date: Feb. 26, 2025*

* Add ability in :class:`~bsk_rl.obs.SatProperties` to define new observations with
  a custom function.
* Add ``deepcopy`` to mutable inputs to the environment so that an environment argument
  dictionary can be copied without being affected by things that happen in the environment.
  This fixes compatibility with RLlib 2.33.0+. Note that this means that the satellite
  object passed to the environment is not the same object as the one used in the environment,
  as is the case for rewarders and communication objects.
* Add additional observation properties for satellites and opportunities.
* Add connectors for multiagent semi-MDPs, as demonstrated in a new `single agent <examples/time_discounted_gae.ipynb>`_
  and `multiagent <examples/async_multiagent_training.ipynb>`_ example.
* Add a ``min_period`` option to :class:`~bsk_rl.comm.CommunicationMethod`.
* Cache ``agents`` in the :class:`~bsk_rl.ConstellationTasking` environment to improve 
  performance.
* Add option to ``generate_obs_retasking_only`` to prevent computing observations for
  satellites that are continuing their current action.
* Allow for :class:`~bsk_rl.sats.ImagingSatellite` to default to a different type of
  opportunity than ``target``. Also allows for access filters to include an opportunity
  type.
* Improve performance of :class:`~bsk_rl.obs.Eclipse` observations by about 95%.
* Logs a warning if the initial battery charge or buffer level is incompatible with its capacity.
* Optimize communication when all satellites are communicating with each other.


Version 1.0.1
-------------
*Release Date: Aug. 29, 2024*

* Change the :class:`~bsk_rl.ConstellationTasking` environment info dictionary to include
  all non-agent information in ``info['__common__']``, which is expected by RLlib's 
  multiagent interfaces.
* Rewarder, communication, scenario, and satellites all have standardized ``reset_overwrite_previous``,
  ``reset_pre_sim_init``, and ``reset_post_sim_init`` methods to all for more complex
  initialization dependencies.
* Replace ``get_access_filter`` with :class:`~bsk_rl.sats.AccessSatellite.add_access_filter`,
  which uses boolean functions to determine which opportunity windows to consider.
* Changed the initial data generation to be defined in :class:`~bsk_rl.data.GlobalReward` 
  instead of :class:`~bsk_rl.scene.Scenario`.
* Added a new :ref:`examples` script that demonstrates how to include
  a targets with cloud coverage and a rewarder that accounts for cloud cover.
* Reformat the info dictionary to be more consistent across environments. All satellites now
  have a ``requires_retasking`` key, as opposed to a global list of satellites that require retasking.
  Each satellite also gets ``d_ts`` in its info dictionary. Info and warning messages are no longer
  saved in the info dict.
* ``log_info`` and ``log_warning`` are deprecated by :class:`~bsk_rl.sats.Satellite`, in favor of
  ``logger.info`` and ``logger.warning``.
* Add ability to correlate ``sat_args`` between satellites with the ``sat_arg_randomizer``
  option in :class:`~bsk_rl.GeneralSatelliteTasking`.  This is demonstrated in the setup
  of a constellation in the `multiagent example <examples/multiagent_envs.ipynb>`_.
* The default solar panel normal direction is now the negative z-axis, which is antiparallel
  to the default instrument direction.


Version 1.0.0
-------------
*Release Date: Jun. 12, 2024*

First major release of BSK-RL. 

* Refactored the repository to prioritize use of the :class:`~bsk_rl.GeneralSatelliteTasking` 
  environment. The general environment is now at the base level of ``bsk_rl``.
* Renamed various elements of the environment for simplicity and clarity. See the 
  :ref:`bsk_rl` for further details.
* Refactored the satellite :ref:`bsk_rl.obs` and :ref:`bsk_rl.act` specification 
  to be more clear and avoid conflicting variable names.
* Rewrote the documentation and added useful :ref:`examples`.
* Deprecated one-off environments and training scripts. These are still accessible
  in the `git history of the repository <https://github.com/AVSLab/bsk_rl/>`_.
