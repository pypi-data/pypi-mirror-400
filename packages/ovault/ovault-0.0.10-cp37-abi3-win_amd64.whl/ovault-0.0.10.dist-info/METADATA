# OVault
A python library for accessing and editing your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault.

> [!WARNING]
> This library can easily make large changes to your vault which may be difficult to reverse.
> Make sure to have a backup of your vault before using OVault to modify it.

Check out the [examples](https://github.com/BalderHolst/ovault/tree/main/examples)!

## Code Example
```python
import ovault

# Open a vault at a given path
vault = ovault.Vault("test-vaults/simple_vault")

print("Vault Path  :", vault.path)
print("Notes       :", len(vault.notes()))
print("Attachments :", len(vault.attachments()))
print("Tags        :", sorted(vault.tags()))
print()

# Get the note named 'first_note'
note = vault.note("first_note")

print("Note Name   :", note.name)
print("Note Path   :", note.path)
print("Note Tokens :", note.tokens())

```

*Output:*
```
Vault Path  : /home/balder/projects/ovault/test-vaults/simple_vault
Notes       : 11
Attachments : 3
Tags        : ['callout4youtag', 'frontmatter-tag1', 'frontmatter-tag2', 'linksaregood']

Note Name   : first_note
Note Path   : first_note.md
Note Tokens : [Header(# FIRST NOTE!), Text(Wuhuuuuuuuuuuu!Thi...), InternalLink(second note), Text(.Takes a look at t...), InternalLink(sub/todo), Text()]
```

## Included Utilities
OVault includes runnable modules for common tasks. Get an overview by running the `ovault` module:
```bash
python -m ovault
```

*Output:*

OVault provies a few utilties out of the box.

You can run them like so: `python3 -m ovault.<module>`

Available modules:

    ovault.check_links            : Check all external links to websites in an Obsidian vault and report any broken links.
    ovault.to_html                : Convert an obsidian vault to a simple static HTML site.
    ovault.mv                     : Rename a file within an Obsidian vault, updating all links accordingly.
    ovault.info                   : Show information about an Obsidian vault.

## Features

#### Vault Management

##### Indexing
- **Indexing:** Automatically indexes all notes and attachments within the vault upon initialization.
- **Ignored Files:** Respects and parses `.vault-ignore` files to exclude specified paths during indexing.
- **Dangling Links:** Identify and list links within your notes that point to non-existent files.

#### Note Handling

##### Access & Properties
- **Access Notes & Attachments:** Retrieve all notes or attachments in the vault as Python objects.
- **Frontmatter Extraction:** Manipulate YAML frontmatter from notes.

##### Modification
- **Dynamic Note Modification:** Programmatically insert or replace parts of a note

#### Tag Management

##### Querying Tags
- **List All Tags:** Get a complete list of tags present in your vault.
- **Filter by Tag:** Retrieve all notes associated with a specific tag.

#### Markdown Parsing & Tokenization

##### Token Representation
- **Rich Token Representation:** Notes are parsed into a detailed stream of `Token` objects, representing various markdown elements.

See `Token` in [`lexer/tokens.rs`](./src/lexer/tokens.rs) for all token definitions.
