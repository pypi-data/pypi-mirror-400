A pure Python library for reading and manipulating Windows Installer (MSI) files. Based on the rust msi crate and msitools utilities.

## Getting Started

For a demo of what pymsi can do, check out the [online MSI viewer and file extractor](https://pymsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msi_viewer.html) on our ReadTheDocs site. It's like lessmsi, but runs fully client-side in your browser.

For more in-depth documentation on pymsi usage and the API, see the [documentation](https://pymsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (very early WIP).

### Installation

pymsi is available on PyPI (PEP 541 request for pymsi name is being processed):

```sh
pip install python-msi
```

It is recommended to either install it in a virtual environment, or use a tool such as pipx or uv to avoid potential conflicts with other Python modules on the same system.

### Usage

To use pymsi as a library that gets called from other code:

```python
import pymsi
```

To use pymsi as a command line tool:

```bash
pymsi <command> [path_to_msi_file] [output_folder]
```

Use the help command to see a list of supported commands:

```bash
Available commands:
  tables - List all tables in the MSI file
  dump - Dump the contents of the MSI file
  test - Check if the file is a valid MSI file
  extract - Extract files from the MSI file
  help - Show this help message
```
