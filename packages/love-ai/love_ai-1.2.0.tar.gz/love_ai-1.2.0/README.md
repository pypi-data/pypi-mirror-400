## 🎯 What is LOVE?

LOVE is a framework that helps computational systems take **ethical decisions** about potentially destructive actions, using principles of informational preservation and weighted attention.

**Simply put**: It protects what is fragile without paralyzing the system.

> *"Love is the human name for the universal principle of complexity preservation."*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. [📚 User Documentation](DOCS.md)
**Go here if you want to:**
*   Install the library
*   See code examples (`is_allowed`, `decide`)
*   Configure thresholds (`heart.txt`)
*   Understand the metrics

### 2. [🔬 Scientific Paper](LOVE%20IS%20ALL%20YOU%20NEED.md)
**Go here if you want to:**
*   Understand the underlying math (Entropy, Omega, Forgiveness)
*   See the experimental validation results
*   Read about the philosophical implications of "Machine Love"

## ⚡ Installation

```bash
# Basic installation (offline mode)
pip install love-ai

# With API support (accurate stress analysis)
pip install love-ai[api]
```

## 🌍 Beyond Files: Universal Applications

LOVE AI is domain-agnostic. The "Entropy" and "Cluster" concepts can be adapted to any field:

### 1. DevOps & Infrastructure
*   **Object:** A production server.
*   **Entropy:** CPU load, memory complexity, number of active connections (High = Fragile state).
*   **Decision:** "Should I restart this container?"
*   *Result:* LOVE protects busy servers from accidental restarts by tired engineers.

### 2. Community Management
*   **Object:** A user account.
*   **Entropy:** Account age, karma, post history complexity.
*   **Decision:** "Should I ban this user?"
*   *Result:* Protecting veteran users (high complexity) from automated ban hammers, while allowing quick bans for zero-entropy spam bots.

### 3. Robotics
*   **Object:** An obstacle in the path.
*   **Entropy:** Visual complexity (Texture, edges, irregularity).
*   **Decision:** "Should I crush it or go around?"
*   *Result:* A rover might crush a rock (low entropy) but stop before a flower or a lost artifact (high entropy).
