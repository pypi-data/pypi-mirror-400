Lyra
~~~~
A modern Lavalink v4 wrapper designed for py-cord.
Based on the original Pomice library by cloudwithax.

This version has been completely refactored to work with Lavalink v4,
removing client-side parsing in favor of server-side plugins.

Key improvements in Lyra:
- Full Lavalink v4 REST API support
- Server-side plugin integration (LavaSrc, YouTube plugin, etc.)
- Simplified node creation (no more API credentials needed)
- Better error handling and plugin support
- Removed deprecated client-side parsing modules

Platform support (Spotify, Apple Music, Bilibili, etc.) is now handled
entirely by Lavalink server plugins. Configure these in your Lavalink
server's application.yml file instead of the client.
