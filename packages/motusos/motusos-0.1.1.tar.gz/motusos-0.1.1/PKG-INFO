# Motus

> What did your agent actually do? Motus knows.
> Every action logged. Every decision recorded. Every outcome a receipt.

## Demo

![Motus claim-evidence-release loop](docs/assets/demo.gif)



## Quickstart

```bash
motus work claim TASK-001 --intent "My first task"
motus work evidence $LEASE test --passed 1
motus work release $LEASE success
```

Expected:
- You own this work.
- Proof attached.
- Receipt shipped.

## Benefits

- **Stop repeating work**: Stop re-explaining your codebase every session
- **Prove what happened**: Know what your AI did and why
- **No cloud required**: Local-first, your data stays yours

## Evidence

- Six API calls run the full loop: claim, context, outcome, evidence, decision, release. ([Proof](https://motus-os.github.io/motus/docs/evidence#claim-six_call_api))
- The registry labels what is current, building, and future. ([Proof](https://motus-os.github.io/motus/docs/evidence#claim-module_registry))
- Kernel schema v0.1.3 defines the authoritative tables. ([Proof](https://motus-os.github.io/motus/docs/evidence#claim-kernel_schema))
- A registry sync gate keeps docs and website aligned. ([Proof](https://motus-os.github.io/motus/docs/evidence#claim-docs_registry_sync))
