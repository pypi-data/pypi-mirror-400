## Checklist for Adoption

See the [adoption guides](https://jupyter-releaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_guides/index.html).

## Actions

GitHub actions scripts are available to draft a changelog, draft a release, publish a release, and check a release.

See the [action details documentation](https://jupyter-releaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/theory.html#action-details) for more information.

The actions can be run on a [fork](https://jupyter-releaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_guides/convert_repo_from_releaser.html) of `jupyter_releaser` and target multiple
repositories, or run as workflows on the [source repositories](https://jupyter-releaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_guides/convert_repo_from_repo.html), using
shared credentials.
