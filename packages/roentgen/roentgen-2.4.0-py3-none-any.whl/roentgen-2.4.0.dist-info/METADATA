A Python package for the quantitative analysis of the interaction of energetic x-rays with matter.
This package is named after one of the discoverers of X-rays, `Wilhelm Röntgen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Röntgen>`_.

Installation
============

::

    pip install roentgen


Documentation
=============

http://roentgen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

GUI
===
This package provides a gui interface to quickly investigate the absorption and transmission of x-rays through different materials.
It is based on `bokeh <https://docs.bokeh.org/en/stable/>`_. To run it locally use the following command

::

   uv run --with 'bokeh' bokeh serve --show gui


Data Sources
