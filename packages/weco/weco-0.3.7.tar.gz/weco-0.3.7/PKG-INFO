              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Weco systematically optimizes your code, guided directly by your evaluation metrics.

Example applications include:

- **GPU Kernel Optimization**: Reimplement PyTorch functions using [CUDA](/examples/cuda/README.md) or [Triton](/examples/triton/README.md), optimizing for `latency`, `throughput`, or `memory_bandwidth`.
- **Model Development**: Tune feature transformations, architectures or [the whole training pipeline](/examples/spaceship-titanic/README.md), optimizing for `validation_accuracy`, `AUC`, or `Sharpe Ratio`.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Refine prompts for LLMs (e.g., for [math problems](/examples/prompt/README.md)), optimizing for `win_rate`, `relevance`, or `format_adherence`

## Overview

The `weco` CLI leverages a tree search approach guided by LLMs to iteratively explore and refine your code. It automatically applies changes, runs your evaluation script, parses the results, and proposes further improvements based on the specified goal.


## Install the Package

```bash
pip install weco
```

## Getting Started

### Quickstart with an example project

**Configure optimization parameters yourself** - If you need precise control over the optimization parameters, you can use the direct `weco run` command:

**Example: Optimizing Simple PyTorch Operations**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WecoAI/weco-cli.git
cd weco-cli/examples/hello-world/
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Weco with configuration
weco run --source module.py \
     --eval-command "python evaluate.py --path module.py" \
     --metric speedup \
     --goal maximize \
     --steps 10 \
     --additional-instructions "Fuse operations in the forward method while ensuring the max float deviation remains small. Maintain the same format of the code."
```

**Note:** If you have an NVIDIA GPU, change the device in the `--eval-command` to `cuda`. If you are running this on Apple Silicon, set it to `mps`.

For more advanced examples, including [Triton](/examples/triton/README.md), [CUDA kernel optimization](/examples/cuda/README.md), [ML model optimization](/examples/spaceship-titanic/README.md), and [prompt engineering for math problems](examples/prompt/README.md), please see the `README.md` files within the corresponding subdirectories under the [`examples/`](examples/) folder.

> Note: When recommend removing any backticks from your code if any are present. We currently don't support backticks but will support this in the future.

### Arguments for `weco run`

**Required:**

| Argument            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  | Example               |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `-s, --source`      | Path to the source code file that will be optimized.                                                                                                                   | `-s model.py`      |
| `-c, --eval-command`| Command to run for evaluating the code in `--source`. This command should print the target `--metric` and its value to the terminal (stdout/stderr). See note below.                        | `-c "python eval.py"` |
| `-m, --metric`      | The name of the metric you want to optimize (e.g., 'accuracy', 'speedup', 'loss'). This metric name does not need to match what's printed by your `--eval-command` exactly (e.g., its okay to use "speedup" instead of "Speedup:").                                    | `-m speedup`          |
| `-g, --goal`        | `maximize`/`max` to maximize the `--metric` or `minimize`/`min` to minimize it.                                                                                                              | `-g maximize`         |

## Command Reference

### Basic Usage Patterns

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `weco run [options]` | Direct optimization execution | **For advanced users** - When you know exactly what to optimize and how |
| `weco resume <run-id>` | Resume an interrupted run | Continue from the last completed step |
| `weco logout` | Clear authentication credentials | To switch accounts or troubleshoot authentication issues |

### Model Selection

You can specify which LLM model to use with the `-M` or `--model` flag:

```bash
weco run --model gpt-5 --source optimize.py [other options...]
```

**Available models (30 total):**

**OpenAI Models:**
- GPT-5 Series: `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5-pro`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`
- O-Series Reasoning: `o3-pro`, `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini`, `o1-pro`, `o1`, `codex-mini-latest`
- GPT-4 Series: `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1-nano`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`

**Anthropic Claude (via Vertex AI):**
- `claude-opus-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-1`, `claude-opus-4`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4`, `claude-haiku-4-5`

**Google Gemini:**
- `gemini-3-pro-preview`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`

All models are available through Weco. If no model is specified, Weco automatically selects the best model for your optimization task.

### Resuming Interrupted Runs

If your optimization run is interrupted (network issues, restart, etc.), resume from the most recent node:

```bash
# Resume an interrupted run
weco resume 0002e071-1b67-411f-a514-36947f0c4b31

```

Arguments for `weco resume`:

| Argument | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `run-id` | The UUID of the run to resume (shown at the start of each run) | `0002e071-1b67-411f-a514-36947f0c4b31` |
| `--apply-change` | Automatically apply the best solution to the source file without prompting | `--apply-change` |
| `--api-key` | (Optional) API keys for LLM providers (BYOK). Format: `provider=key` | `--api-key openai=sk-xxx` |

Notes:
- Works only for interrupted runs (status: `error`, `terminated`, etc.).
- You’ll be prompted to confirm that your evaluation environment (source file + evaluation command) hasn’t changed.
- The source file is restored to the most recent solution before continuing.
- All progress and metrics from the original run are preserved.
- Log directory, save-logs behavior, and evaluation timeout are reused from the original run.

### Performance & Expectations

Weco, powered by the AIDE algorithm, optimizes code iteratively based on your evaluation results. Achieving significant improvements, especially on complex research-level tasks, often requires substantial exploration time.

The following plot from the independent [Research Engineering Benchmark (RE-Bench)](https://metr.org/AI_R_D_Evaluation_Report.pdf) report shows the performance of AIDE (the algorithm behind Weco) on challenging ML research engineering tasks over different time budgets.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff0e471d-2f50-4e2d-b718-874862f533df" alt="RE-Bench Performance Across Time" width="60%"/>
</p>

As shown, AIDE demonstrates strong performance gains over time, surpassing lower human expert percentiles within hours and continuing to improve. This highlights the potential of evaluation-driven optimization but also indicates that reaching high levels of performance comparable to human experts on difficult benchmarks can take considerable time (tens of hours in this specific benchmark, corresponding to many `--steps` in the Weco CLI). Factor this into your planning when setting the number of `--steps` for your optimization runs.

### Saving Execution Logs

When using the `--save-logs` flag, Weco saves the execution output from each optimization step to help with debugging and analysis. The logs are organized as follows:

```
.runs/
└── <source-file-name>/
    └── <run-uuid>/
        ├── exec_output.jsonl      # Index file with metadata for each step
        ├── outputs/
        │   ├── step_0.out.txt      # Raw output from initial evaluation
        │   ├── step_1.out.txt      # Raw output from step 1
        │   ├── step_2.out.txt      # Raw output from step 2
        │   └── ...
        ├── step_0.py               # Code snapshot from initial evaluation
        ├── step_1.py               # Code snapshot from step 1
        ├── step_2.py               # Code snapshot from step 2
        └── ...
```

Each run is organized under the source file name (e.g., `spaceship-titanic` for `spaceship-titanic.py`) and a unique UUID. The `outputs/` directory and `exec_output.jsonl` file are only created when the `--save-logs` flag is used.

The `exec_output.jsonl` file contains one JSON object per line with:
- `step`: The optimization step number
- `timestamp`: When the execution occurred
- `output_file`: Relative path to the full output file
- `output_length`: Total length of the output

This is particularly useful for:
- Debugging why certain optimizations fail
- Analyzing patterns in evaluation results
- Keeping records of long-running optimization sessions
- Troubleshooting evaluation script issues

### Important Note on Evaluation

The command specified by `--eval-command` is crucial. It's responsible for executing the potentially modified code from `--source` and assessing its performance. **This command MUST print the metric you specified with `--metric` along with its numerical value to the terminal (standard output or standard error).** Weco reads this output to understand how well each code version performs and guide the optimization process.

For example, if you set `--metric speedup`, your evaluation script (`eval.py` in the examples) should output a line like:

```
speedup: 1.5
```

or

```
Final speedup value = 1.5
```

Weco will parse this output to extract the numerical value (1.5 in this case) associated with the metric name ('speedup').

**Note on Output Truncation:** When evaluation output exceeds 51,000 characters, Weco truncates it to show the first 25,000 and last 25,000 characters. For best results, ensure your evaluation script prints the metric value near the end of its output.
