Pad is an easy to use terminal code editor for those of us who aren't into vim.

## Features

- Runs in the terminal, works great with ghostty
- Responsive, resize the window and it still looks good
- Text editor with code highlighting for the current open file
- If not pointed at a file, opens the current directory, default open file is any README.md that may exist
- Autoclosing of parenthesis, curly braces, brackets, and quotes
- VS Code inspired keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation and editing:
    - `ctrl+c:` copy text
    - `ctrl+v:` paste text
    - `ctrl+z:` undo
    - `ctrl+s:` save current file
    - `ctrl+f:` search in current file
    - `ctrl+g:` go to line
    - `ctrl+b:` file browser
    - `ctrl+o:` file search
    - `ctrl+shift+f`: Fast file content search

## Install

```sh
uv tool pad-app
```

Currently Pad is untested with any other installation method. If it works for your installation method, let me know and I'll add it to this section.

## Usage

Once installed, point it at a file: 

```sh
pad myproject/README.md
```

Or a directory:

```sh
pad myproject/
```

## How licensing works

You get 7 days to try Pad for free. After that, you'll need to purchase a subscription to continue using it.

A subscription includes 10 device activations. This accounts for spare devices, operating system resets, and even sharing with a few friends so they can try out Pad. If you run out of activitions for your individual needs, let us know and we'll figure something out.

If you want to purchase Pad for a team, contact us, and we'll set you up with a custom plan.
