def get_results(model: N2PModelContent, loadCaseList: list[N2PLoadCase], cornerData: bool = False): 

    """
    Method used to obtain two numpy arrays with all important results that have to be saved in memory. The results 
    arrays are 3D numpy arrays in which the first dimension corresponds to each load case, the second dimension 
    corresponds to the type of result, and the third dimension corresponds to the value in each element. Therefore, the 
    arrays' dimensions will be a*b*c, where a is the number of load cases, b is the ammount of results that are asked 
    for (9 for the regular results array and 6 for the corner data results array), and c is the number of elements in 
    which results are asked (for the regular results array, c will be the number of elements in the model and, for the 
    corner results array, c will be the number of elements * the number of nodes in each element). The innermost 
    array is ordered by the elements' internal IDs, just like the results directly extracted. The results that are 
    obtained are the following: 
        - FX 1D 
        - FY 1D 
        - FZ 1D 
        - FX 
        - FY 
        - FXY 
        - MX 
        - MY 
        - MXY 
        - FX CORNER
        - FY CORNER 
        - FXY CORNER 
        - MX CORNER 
        - MY CORNER 
        - MXY CORNER
    If cornerData is set to False, the corner results array will simply be np.array([]) 

    Args: 
        model: N2PModelContent -> compulsory input.
        loadcase: list[N2PLoadCase] -> load cases to be studied. 
        cornerData: bool = False -> boolean which shows whether the corner data is to be used or not.
        jointType: str = "CFAST" -> string which shows what is the joint's type. 

    Returns: 
        resultsList: np.ndarray  
        resultsListCorner: np.ndarray 
        brokenLC: list[N2PLoadCase] -> list of broken load cases. 

    If results have been obtained in the corner, it is recommended to use them, as this data will be more accurate and 
    the computed bypass loads will be more precise, but the process is slower. Therefore, when cornerData is set to 
    False, a warning will appear. 

    It is important to note that, if cornerData is set to False and there are actually results in the corner, the 
    program should function correctly (just not taking into account this data). Similarly, if cornerData is set to True 
    but there is no corner data in the results, the arrays corresponding to the corner forces will be filled with 
    nan. This is not problematic (it just takes longer), but it could be bad if this data is used for the bypass 
    calculations for obvious reasons. 

    Currently, the following solvers are supported: 
        - Nastran and InputFileNastran 
        - Abaqus and InputFileAbaqus 

    Calling example: 
        >>> myResults, myResultsCorner, brokenLoadCases = get_results(model1, model1.LoadCases[0:10], False)
