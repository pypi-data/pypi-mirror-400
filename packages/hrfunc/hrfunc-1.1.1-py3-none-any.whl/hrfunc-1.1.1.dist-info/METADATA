# HRFunc
HRFunc is a Python library for estimating hemodynamic response functions and neural activity from hemoglobin concentration in functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), through modeling hemodynamic response functions through the brain recorded from fNIRS signals and deconvolving neural activity. Toeplitz deconvolution with Tikhonov regularization is employed for HRF and neural activity estimation. For more guidance on using the HRfunc tool, visit www.hrfunc.org for in-depth guides and demo videos.

## Installation

You can easily install hrfunc via pip, as long as you have Python version 3.8 or higher.

```bash
pip install hrfunc
```

## Quickstart ##

You can estimate channel-wise hemodynamic response functions and neural activity directly within your subjects fNIRS data through the hrfunc library. The hrfunc.montage() object orchestrates these estimations through 5 steps: 

1. Prepare your fNIRS and event data
2. Initialize an HRfunc montage
3. Estimate subject-level HRFs
4. Calculate a subject-pool wide HRF distribution
5. Estimate neural activity in each subjects scans

## 1. Preparing Data for HRfunc ##

HRfunc leverages the MNE Python libraries standard fNIRS scan objects
to estimate HRFs and neural activity. To prepare you're data, simply
load each raw fNIRS scan through MNE and create an event impulse timeseries
representing when events occured in the scan.

```python

# - - - -  1. Prepare Your fNIRS Data - - - - #
# Load in your raw fNIRS data through the MNE library
# and append to a list of scans for easy access and iteration

# NOTE: This is just an example of how you can load your fNIRS
# data and events, in the end all you need is fNIRS data loaded
# through MNE and a list of 0's and 1's representing when events
# occured during your scan.

import mne

# - Create a List of All of Your Subject Filepaths

scan_paths = ['path/to/sub-1.snirf', 
    'path/to/another/sub_2.snirf',
    'path/to/yet/another/sub_3.snirf']

# (Optional hack) use glob to grab them all! 

from glob import glob
# Use *, **, or ? (wildcards) to define ambiguous file patterns
scan_paths = glob("path/**/sub*.snirf") # and grab all your files in one pass

#  - Load Raw fNIRS Data through MNE -

raw_scans = []
for path in scan_paths: # Load through you're datatypes mne.io read call
    raw_scans.append(mne.io.read_raw_snirf(path)) # All MNE fNIRS formats will work


# - - - -  Prepare Your Events - - - - #
# Load/create a list of 0's and 1's representing when events occur
# in your fNIRS data. This list must be at most the same length

with open("task_events.txt", "r") as file:
    events = [int(line.split('/n')[0] for line in file.readlines()]

```

## HRfunc Usage Example ##

Once you're data is loaded, you can start to estimate HRFs
and neural activity through HRfunc!

```python

# - - - - 2. Initialize an HRfunc montage - - - - #
# Pass in one of your scans into the hrf.montage() to intialize
# an HRF estimation node for each of your montages optodes.

import hrfunc as hrf

montage = hrf.montage(scan)


# - - - - 3. Estimate Subject Level HRFs - - - - #
# Pass each of your scans and their corresponding events
# into the estimate_hrfs() function to estimate subject level 
# channel-wise estimates.

for scan in raw_scans:
    montage.estimate_hrfs(scan, events, duration = 30.0)


# - - - - 4. Generate a Subject-Pool HRF Distribution - - - - #
# Generate channel-wise HRF estimates across the subject pool

montage.generate_distribution()
montage.save("study_HRFs.json")


# - - - - 5. Estimate Neural Activity - - - - # 
# Use the subject-pool wide HRF estimates to estimate
# channel wise neural activity for each subject

for scan in scans:
    # Estimate neural activity and replace in-place of the MNE object
    montage.estimate_activity(scan)

    # Save the scan
    scan.save(f"neural_activity_{scan.filename}")

```

After estimating HRF's and publishing a paper detailing how your dataset was collecting you can submit you're estimated HRFs to be added to the HRtree for the wider neuroimaging community to use in their own work. For guides on uploading neural activity, visit [HRfunc.org/hrf_upload](https://www.hrfunc.org/hrf_upload)


## HRtree Usage Example ##
WARNING: The HRtree is currently very limited in the HRF's available and
you may need to estimate your own HRF's or rely on a canonical HRF for
estimating neural activity

HRfunc can only estimate HRFs from fNIRS data with events occuring during
the scan. In these situations you could skip straight to estimating neural
activity and rely on a canonical HRF.

Alternatively you could search the HRtree for experimentally related
HRF's! HRfunc's hybrid tree-hash table data structure has a number of
useful functions to search for useful HRF's

```python

# - - - - Localize HRFs with your Context of Interest - - - - #
import hrfunc as hrf

# Localize any HRF's within range that contain task and age requested
montage = hrf.localize_hrfs(scan, max_distance = 0.001, task = 'flanker', age = [5, 6, 7])

# - - - - Filter Again for Another Experimental Context - - - - #
montage = montage.branch(demographic = ["black", "women"])

# - - - - Further Filter the Montage by Percent Similarity - - - - #
# Filter for specifically HRF's that meet a similarity threshold (95% in this case)
montage.filter(similarity_threshold = 0.95)

# - - - - Estimate Neural Activity using Found HRFs - - - - #
# NOTE: Relies on canonical HRF for a given optode if no 
# HRF was found for the given optode/experimental context
for scan in raw_scans:
    montage.estimate_acivity(scan)

```
