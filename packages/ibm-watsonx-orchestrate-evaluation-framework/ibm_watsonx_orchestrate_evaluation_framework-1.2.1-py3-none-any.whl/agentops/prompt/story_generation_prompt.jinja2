- Centers on the user's primary objective and the key actions they take to achieve it.
- Includes only information directly relevant to understanding the user's goals and context.
- Excludes intermediate steps or process details that do not directly impact the user's outcome.
- Avoids repetition and omits any duplicate or unnecessary details.
- Captures the essence of the user's intent and required actions without commentary or extraneous explanation.

The final story should be brief, direct, and goal-oriented.
