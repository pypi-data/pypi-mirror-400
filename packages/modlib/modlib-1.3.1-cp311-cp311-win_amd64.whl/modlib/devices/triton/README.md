**SETUP**

1. POE + camera + wired network cable + network adapter compatible with device requirements [ArenaSDK docs](https://support.thinklucid.com/arena-sdk-documentation/)
2. triton_firmware_1.1.7
3. IPv4 Method Manual: 
- Address: 169.254.0.1
- Netmask: 255.255.0.0


**Prerequisites**

1. Arena SDK (e.g. Linux x64 or ARM64 or Windows)

Observe: From Spring 2025, Arena SDK does not support Ubuntu20 (glibc >= 2.34).

Download from: https://thinklucid.com/downloads-hub/
Unzip and make sure to make the .dll and .so available

```
tar -xvzf ArenaSDK_<sdk-version-number>_Linux_x64.tar.gz
cd /path/to/ArenaSDK_Linux
sudo sh Arena_SDK_Linux_x64.conf
```

Ensure proper communication with the device:

```
