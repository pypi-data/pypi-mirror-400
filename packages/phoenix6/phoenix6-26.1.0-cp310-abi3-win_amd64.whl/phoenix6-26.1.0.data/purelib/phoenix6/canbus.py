    Class for getting information about an available CAN bus.

    A CANBus can optionally be constructed with an associated
    hoot file, which loads it for replay (equivalent to calling
    HootReplay.load_file).
    
    Only one hoot log may be replayed at a time, so only one CAN
    bus should be constructed with a hoot file.

    When using relative paths, the file path is typically relative
    to the top-level folder of the robot project.

    For the native roboRIO CAN bus, use CANBus.roborio(str | None) instead.

    :param canbus: Name of the CAN bus. Possible CAN bus strings are:

        - "rio" for the native roboRIO CAN bus
        - CANivore name or serial number
        - SocketCAN interface (non-FRC Linux only)
        - "*" for any CANivore seen by the program
        - empty string (default) to select the default for the system:

            - "rio" on roboRIO
            - "can0" on Linux
            - "*" on Windows
