    Get async database session context manager.

    This provides plugins with access to the database through an opaque
    session object. Plugins can use this session to query and persist data
    using SQLAlchemy ORM.

        AsyncSession: Database session for async operations

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If session factory has not been registered by backend

    Example:
        ```python
        from huitzo_sdk.database import get_async_session_context
        from huitzo_sdk.protocols.command import CommandContext, CommandResult

        async def execute(

    Note:
        - Sessions are automatically rolled back on exceptions
        - Sessions are automatically committed if no exceptions occur
        - Always use async/await with this context manager
        - The session is only valid within the context manager scope
