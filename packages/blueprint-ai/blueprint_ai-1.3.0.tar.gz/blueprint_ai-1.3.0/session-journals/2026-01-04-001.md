# Blueprint Session 2026-01-04-001 — COMPLETE

## Session Focus: Public Release Execution

### Executive Summary

**Blueprint v1.2.0 shipped to PyPI and GitHub.** First public Zero Echelon product released. Multi-agent fleet review incorporated, sanitization executed, package published.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Outpost Fleet Review
- Dispatched PUBLIC_RELEASE_PROCEDURE.md to 4 agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Aider)
- Received comprehensive feedback on security gaps, PyPI steps, script improvements
- Key findings: license mismatch (MIT→Apache), missing PyPI build steps, brittle regex sanitization

### 2. License Decision
- Analyzed MIT vs Apache 2.0 tradeoffs
- Selected **Apache 2.0** for patent protection and enterprise adoption
- Fixed pyproject.toml: `license = "MIT"` → `license = "Apache-2.0"`
