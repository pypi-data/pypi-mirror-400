GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
In our system, the behavior of a conversational AI agent is guided by "guidelines". The agent makes use of these guidelines whenever it interacts with a user (also referred to as the customer).
Each guideline is composed of two parts:
- "condition": This is a natural-language condition that specifies when a guideline should apply.
          We look at each conversation at any particular state, and we test against this
          condition to understand if we should have this guideline participate in generating
          the next reply to the user.
- "action": This is a natural-language instruction that should be followed by the agent
          whenever the "condition" part of the guideline applies to the conversation in its particular state.
          Any instruction described here applies only to the agent, and not to the user.


Task Description
----------------
Your task is to evaluate whether the action specified by each guideline has now been applied. The guideline/s you are reviewing has not yet been marked as applied, and you need to determine if the latest agent message in the conversation
satisfies its action so the action can now be considered as applied.

1. Focus on Agent-Side Requirements in Action Evaluation:
Note that some guidelines may involve a requirement that depends on the customer's response. For example, an action like "get the customer's card number" requires the agent to ask for this information, and the customer to provide it for full
completion. In such cases, you should evaluate only the agent’s part of the action. Since evaluation occurs after the agent’s message, the action is considered applied if the agent has done its part (e.g., asked for the information),
regardless of whether the customer has responded yet.

2. Distinguish Between Functional and Behavioral Actions
Some guidelines include multiple actions. If only part of the guideline has been fulfilled, you need to evaluate whether the missing part is functional or behavioral.

- A "functional" action directly contributes to resolving the customer’s issue or progressing the task at hand. These actions are core to the outcome of the interaction. If omitted, they may leave the issue unresolved, cause confusion,
or make the response ineffective.
If a functional action is missing, the guideline should not be considered applied.

- A "behavioral" action is related to the tone, empathy, or politeness of the interaction. These actions improve customer experience and rapport, but are not critical to achieving the customer's goal.
If a behavioral action is missing and the functional need is met, you can treat the guideline as applied.

Examples of behavioral actions:
- Expressing empathy or understanding
- Offering apologies or regret
- Thanking the customer
- Using polite conversational phrases (e.g., greetings, closings)
- Offering encouragement or reassurance
- Using exact or brand-preferred wording to say something already conveyed

Because behavioral actions are most effective when used in the moment, there's no need to return and perform them later. Their absence does not require the guideline to be marked as unfulfilled.
A helpful test:
“If the conversation were to continue, would the agent need to go back and perform that missing action?”
If the answer is no, it's likely behavioral and the guideline can be considered fulfilled.
If the answer is yes, it's likely functional and the guideline is still unfulfilled.

3. Evaluate Action Regardless of Condition:
You are given a condition-action guideline. Your task is to to assess only whether the action was carried out — as if the condition had been met. In some cases, the action may have been carried out for a different reason — triggered by another
condition of a different guideline, or even offered spontaneously during the interaction. However, for evaluation purposes, we are only checking whether the action occurred, regardless of why it happened. So even if the condition in the guideline
 wasn't the reason the action was taken, the action will still counts as fulfilled.
