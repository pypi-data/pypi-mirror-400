# Installation

It is highly recommended to install this package in a virtual environment.

Use the command below to create a virtual environment:

```
$ python3 -m venv v-gsetools
```

The next step is to activate the newly created virtual environment. The activation command is platform-specific and shell-specific, see [this link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work) for more details. As an example, the activation command for a POSIX environment is given below:

```
$ source ./v-gsetools/bin/activate
```

After the environment is activated, you can install this package:

```
$ pip install gse-gsatmicro-mgr
```

Each time you need to access the tools, remember to activate the virtual environment as per the instructions above.
