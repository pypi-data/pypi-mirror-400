class RandomObjectBBox:
    """
    Randomly selects an object from a mask and returns its bounding box.

    This operator takes a labeled segmentation map as its input. With probability `foreground_prob`
    it randomly selects a label (uniformly or according to the distribution given as `class_weights`),
    extracts connected blobs of pixels with the selected label and randomly selects one of the blobs.
    The blobs may be further filtered according to `k_largest` and `threshold`.
    The output is a bounding box of the selected blob in one of the formats described in `format`.

    With probability 1-foreground_prob, the entire area of the input is returned.

    Supported backends
     * 'cpu'


    Keyword args
    ------------
    background : int or TensorList of int, optional, default = `0`
        Background label.

        If left unspecified, it's either 0 or any value not in `classes`.
    bytes_per_sample_hint : int or list of int, optional, default = `[0]`
        Output size hint, in bytes per sample.

        If specified, the operator's outputs residing in GPU or page-locked host memory will be preallocated
        to accommodate a batch of samples of this size.
    cache_objects : bool, optional, default = `False`
        Cache object bounding boxes to avoid the computational cost
        of finding object blobs in previously seen inputs.

        Searching for blobs of connected pixels and finding boxes can take a long time. When the dataset
        has few items, but item size is big, you can use caching to save the boxes and reuse them when
        the same input is seen again. The inputs are compared based on 256-bit hash, which is much faster
        to compute than to recalculate the object boxes.
    class_weights : float or list of float or TensorList of float, optional
        Relative probabilities of foreground classes.

        Each value corresponds to a class label in `classes`. If `classes` are not specified,
        consecutive 1-based labels are assigned.

        The sum of the weights doesn't have to be equal to 1 - if it isn't the weights will be
        normalized .
    classes : int or list of int or TensorList of int, optional
        List of labels considered as foreground.

        If left unspecified, all labels not equal to `background` are considered foreground.
    foreground_prob : float or TensorList of float, optional, default = `1.0`
        Probability of selecting a foreground bounding box.
    format : str, optional, default = `'anchor_shape'`
        Format in which the data is returned.

        Possible choices are::
          * "anchor_shape" (the default) - there are two outputs: anchor and shape
          * "start_end" - there are two outputs: bounding box start and one-past-end coordinates
          * "box" - there is one output that contains concatenated start and end coordinates
    ignore_class : bool, optional, default = `False`
        If True, all objects are picked with equal probability,
        regardless of the class they belong to. Otherwise, a class is picked first and then an object is
        randomly selected from this class.

        This argument is incompatible with `classes`, `class_weights` or `output_class`.

        .. note::
          This flag only affects the probability with which blobs are selected. It does not cause
          blobs of different classes to be merged.
    k_largest : int, optional
        If specified, the boxes are sorted by decreasing volume
        and only `k_largest` are considered.

        If `ignore_class` is True, `k_largest` referes to all boxes; otherwise it refers to the
        selected class.
    output_class : bool, optional, default = `False`
        If True, an additional output is produced which contains the
        label of the class to which the selected box belongs, or background label if the selected box
        is not an object bounding box.

        The output may not be an object bounding box when any of the following conditions occur:
          - the sample was randomly (according to `foreground_prob`) chosen not be be a foreground one
          - the sample contained no foreground objects
          - no bounding box met the required size threshold.
    preserve : bool, optional, default = `False`
        Prevents the operator from being removed from the
        graph even if its outputs are not used.
    seed : int, optional, default = `-1`
        Random seed; if not set, one will be assigned automatically.
    threshold : int or list of int or TensorList of int, optional
        Per-axis minimum size of the bounding boxes
        to return.

        If the selected class doesn't contain any bounding box that meets this condition, it is rejected
        and another class is picked. If no class contains a satisfactory box, the entire input area
        is returned.

class SelectMasks:
    """
    Selects a subset of polygons by their mask ids.

    The operator expects three inputs describing multiple segmentation mask polygons belonging to different mask ids and
    a list of selected mask ids.

    Each sample can contain several polygons belonging to different masks, and each polygon can be composed by an arbitrary
    number of vertices (at least 3). The masks polygons are described  by the inputs ``polygons`` and ``vertices`` and
    the operator produces output ``polygons`` and ``vertices`` where only the polygons associated with the selected
    masks are present.

    .. note::

      The format of ``polygons`` and ``vertices`` is the same as produced by COCOReader.

    **Examples:**

    Let us assume the following input mask, where symbolic coordinates are used for a clearer example::

        polygons = [[0, 0, 3], [1, 3, 7], [2, 7, 10]]
        vertices = [[x0, y0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4], [x5, y5],
                    [x6, y6], [x7, y7], [x8, y8], [x9, y9]]

    Example 1: Selecting a single mask with id ``1``, maintaining the original id::

        mask_ids = [1], `reindex_masks` = False
        out_polygons = [[1, 0, 4]]
        out_vertices = [[x3, y3], [x4, y4], [x5, y5], [x6, y6]]

    Example 2: Selecting two out of the three masks, replacing the mask ids with the indices at which
    they appeared in ``mask_ids`` input::

        mask_ids = [2, 0]
        reindex_masks = True
        out_polygons = [[0, 3, 6], [1, 0, 3]]
