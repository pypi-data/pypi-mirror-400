I'll help you identify the issues with the getting started examples and propose a fix plan. Let me first read the README files to understand the expected setup and then examine the example scripts.

Now let me read the getting started README to understand the expected setup:

Now let me examine the individual getting started scripts to understand what dependencies they require:

Let me read the second script:

Now let me examine the third script:

Let me check the 4th and 5th scripts as well:

Now let me check the 5th script:

Now let me run the first script to see the actual error:

Let me check the project configuration to understand the dependencies:

Let me check if there's a virtual environment or if we need to install the package:

Based on my analysis of the repository structure and the getting started examples, I can identify the issue and propose a fix plan. Let me examine the project configuration and structure further to understand the complete picture:

Let me search for DuckDB imports and fsspeckit dataset imports:

Now I have a clear understanding of the issues. Based on my analysis, here's the problem and a comprehensive fix plan:

## Problem Identification

The getting started examples are failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyarrow'` because the required dependencies are not installed. Looking at the pyproject.toml file and the example code, these scripts require several dependencies that are not currently available in the environment.

## Comprehensive Fix Plan

### 1. Install the Package in Development Mode
First, you need to install the `fsspeckit` package with its dependencies:

```bash
cd /home/volker/coding/fsspeckit
pip install -e ".[datasets]"
```

This will install the package and the datasets extra dependencies which include:
- pyarrow>=22.0.0 (needed for all examples)
- duckdb>=1.4.0 (needed for DuckDB examples)
- pandas>=2.2.0 (general data operations)
- polars>=1.30.0 (alternative dataframe library)

### 2. Install Missing Dependencies
If the above installation didn't work properly, install the core dependencies separately:

```bash
pip install pyarrow>=22.0.0
pip install duckdb>=1.4.0
pip install pandas>=2.2.0
pip install polars>=1.30.0
```

### 3. Verify Installation
After installing the dependencies, verify that they can be imported:

```bash
python -c "import pyarrow as pa; import duckdb; from fsspeckit.datasets import DuckDBParquetHandler; print('All imports successful')"
```

### 4. Run the Examples in Expected Order
Once dependencies are installed, run the examples in the recommended order:

```bash
cd /home/volker/coding/fsspeckit
python examples/datasets/getting_started/01_duckdb_basics.py
python examples/datasets/getting_started/02_pyarrow_basics.py
python examples/datasets/getting_started/03_simple_merges.py
python examples/datasets/getting_started/04_pyarrow_merges.py
python examples/datasets/getting_started/05_duckdb_upserts.py
```

### 5. Potential Additional Issues to Address

Based on the code, there are a few potential API-related issues that may need attention:

#### Issue 1: Missing Function Implementations
Looking at the examples, they reference functions like `optimize_parquet_dataset_pyarrow` and `compact_parquet_dataset_pyarrow` which may not be fully implemented in the current version. The scripts have fallbacks for when these functions are not available.

#### Issue 2: Internal API Usage
Some examples access internal APIs like `handler._connection.connection` which might not be available in the current release. The examples assume a certain interface that may not match the actual implementation.

### 6. Recommended Verification Steps

After installation, verify each component works:

1. **PyArrow functionality**: Test basic table operations
2. **DuckDB functionality**: Test DuckDBParquetHandler instantiation and basic operations
3. **Dataset merging functionality**: Test the merge functions

### 7. Troubleshooting Checklist

If you encounter additional issues after installation:

- Check Python version compatibility (needs Python >= 3.11)
- Check if the current codebase has the expected API functions
- Verify that the `DuckDBParquetHandler` class exists and has expected methods
- Make sure the fsspeckit package is properly built and installed

### Summary of Required Actions:

1. **Primary Action**: Run `pip install -e ".[datasets]"` in the `/home/volker/coding/fsspeckit` directory to install all required dependencies.
2. **Verification**: Test basic imports before running the examples.
3. **Execution**: Run the examples in numerical order (01 through 05).
4. **Backup Plan**: If the package installation fails, install dependencies individually and address any API mismatches between expected and available interfaces.

The core issue is simply missing dependencies, but there could be additional API compatibility issues depending on the current state of the fsspeckit codebase.
