1. **nhsmm** remains **open source forever**.  
2. **`nhsmm-interfaces`** serves as a **research & early access layer**, available to Patreon supporters during the preview.  
3. SAE evolves from `nhsmm-interfaces` as the **commercial/research-hardened product**, with early access via the Founders tier.  
4. Supporting Patreon helps fund ongoing development, research, and documentation.
