class FeatureResidualizer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self):
        """Feature transformer that reduces multicollinearity by residualizing highly correlated features.

        For each feature strongly correlated (above `corrcoef` threshold) with others, this class:
        1. Fits a linear regression model using the correlated features as predictors.
        2. Replaces the original feature with residuals (observed - predicted) from the model,
        effectively removing linear dependencies.

        Useful as a preprocessing step for linear models where multicollinearity is problematic.

        Attributes
        ----------
        models_ : Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]
            Dictionary storing residualization models for each processed feature.
            Keys are feature indices; values are dicts with:
            - "model": Fitted `LinearRegression` object.
            - "features": Indices of features used as predictors.
        feature_names_in_ : Optional[np.ndarray]
            Names of input features if provided in a pandas DataFrame.
        n_features_in_ : Optional[int]
            Number of features seen during fit.

        Notes
        -----
        - Computes absolute Pearson correlations between all feature pairs (ignoring self-correlations)
        - Processes features in descending order of total correlation with others
        - For each target feature:
          - Selects correlated predictors (≥ threshold) not yet residualized
          - Fits linear model: target ~ predictors
          - Replaces target feature with model residuals
          - Excludes residualized features from future predictor sets
        - Preserves:
          - Feature order and non-correlated features
          - Non-linear relationships
        - Prevents circular dependencies by marking residualized features
        - Only removes linear relationships between features
