## Description

**form_core_pygame** is a form management system for data entry within Pygame applications. It features a modular design that allows for easy expansion and the development of new container types and widgets.

The utility of some of the already developed widgets can, on its own, justify the use of this module.

## Project Status

A significant amount of functionality has been developed; however, less progress has been made regarding aesthetic aspects. These visual elements will receive much more attention in future versions.
