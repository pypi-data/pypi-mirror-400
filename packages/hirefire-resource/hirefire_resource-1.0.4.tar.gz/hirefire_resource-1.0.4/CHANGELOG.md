## v1.0.4

* Add `celery_app` parameter to `job_queue_size` and `async_job_queue_size` for priority queue support. This fixes RabbitMQ `PRECONDITION_FAILED` errors when querying queues configured with custom arguments like `x-max-priority`. The `celery_app` parameter allows extracting queue arguments from the app's `task_queues` configuration.

## v1.0.3

* Mitigate issue where measuring the Celery job queue size and job queue latency results in connection reset errors. If a connection is reset, the macro will attempt to reconnect and retry the operation up to 10 times over a span of 10 seconds before giving up. The ConnectionResetError typically resolves after the initial reconnection attempt, so this should help alleviate the issue.

## v1.0.2

* Fix issue where Django's HttpResponse object doesn't accept the headers keyword argument. Headers are now applied to the response object directly.

## v1.0.1

* Add support for dashes in `Worker` names to match the Procfile process naming format. `Worker` is implicitly used when configuring HireFire using the `Configuration#dyno` method.

## v1.0.0

* Initial release.
