Antsibull Nox Helper Release Notes
==================================

.. contents:: Topics

v1.5.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix and feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Allow to configure which files and directories are modules and module utils (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/181).
- Allow to define the Python code files that the linters should run on (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/178, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/181).
- Allow to set minimum Python version supported by a collection. This is currently used for the ``[sessions.ansible_test_integration_w_default_container]`` section (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/163, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/176).
- Allow to specify special configs for modules for all formatters and linters in the ``lint`` section (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/181).
- Format messages nicely outside CI, or when not configured otherwise (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/175).
- Improve error reporting system used by internal scripts (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/171).
- Improve output parsing and formatting for pylint and mypy checks (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/171).
- In the ``ruff check`` and ``ruff check --fix`` checks, make sure to run ruff in a ``ansible_collections/<namespace>/<name>/`` structure so that import classification works correctly. The output of these checks is now handled as JSON and parsed and then formatted by antsibull-nox (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/171).
- When antsibull-docs 2.24.0+ is available, the ``docs-check`` session now uses its JSON message format (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/173).

Bugfixes
--------

- Extra code files were ignored so far in the ``pylint`` test. They are now used there as well (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/181).
- Fix ``antsibull-nox-config`` session in case antsibull-nox has not been installed in ``$PATH`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/169).
- Fix reporting of locations when running yamllint for YAML code blocks in RST extra docs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/177).
- Only pass ``--color [yes]`` to ansible-test when nox is running in color mode (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/174).
- Remove superfluous call from the ``antsibull-nox-config`` session (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/172).

v1.4.1
======

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- Avoid construct that does not work with Pythons before 3.13 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/165).
- Fix compatibility with Python 3.9, and for Python versions < 3.12 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/168).

v1.4.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

New bugfix and feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add Python 3.15 to Python version search list (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/142).
- Allow to specify extra ``requirements.yml`` files for ansible-lint (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/156, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/161).
- Also look for needed collections before running ansible-lint `in other places that ansible-lint searches for requirements.yml <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/blob/main/src/ansiblelint/rules/syntax_check.md#syntax-checkunknown-module>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/156, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/159).
- Declare support for Python 3.14 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/141).
- Use Python 3.14 for antsibull-nox action (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/141).
- When determining changed files for pylint and mypy, also consider files that (transitively) import the changed files (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/143).
- When running ansible-galaxy to list, download, or install collections, look in the current session's venv first (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/155, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/157, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/158, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/160).

Bugfixes
--------

- Adjust URLs for antsibull-nox in new templated noxfiles (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/148).
- Avoid using relative symlinks to link from temporary collection root to collections. This can cause problems with non-canonical paths (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/152, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/153).
- If pylint's output is not valid JSON, show output instead of crashing (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/140).
- When computing Python 3 only paths for black or pylint, do not recurse into ``__pycache__`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/143).
- When determining which files to run various Python linters on when change detection is enabled, ensure to restrict to Python files (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/146).
- Work around `bug in ansible-galaxy when no collections are found <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73127>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/154).

v1.3.2
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release.

v1.3.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix ``mypy`` invocation in ``typing`` session. For some reason the file list always ended up empty and ``mypy`` got skipped (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/137).
- isort invocation - make sure to pass ``--src`` in an appropriate directory structure to ensure correct and more consistent sorting (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/134, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/136).

v1.3.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature and bugfix release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Allow to add tags to integration test sessions, automatically add tags to all sessions showing up in the matrix, and allow filtering the CI matrix generated by the shared workflow by these tags (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/125, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/125, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/126).
- Allow to specify Ansible variables in integration tests directly or through environment variables with new ``ansible_vars`` config directive (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/117).
- Allow to specify a list of packages, requirement files, and constraint files for every ``_package`` key in the config (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/108, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/119).
- Allow to specify individual ansible-test integration sessions with the new ``[sessions.ansible_test_integration]`` config setting (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/114, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/118).
- Allow to specify minimum/maximum ansible-core version to ``matrix-generator`` session and shared workflow (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/113, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/115, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/126).
- Antsibull-nox now supports VCS configuration and basic change detection.
  At the moment, the following tests support change detection:

  * All ansible-test tests configured through ``antsibull-nox.toml``;
  * All ansible-test tests configured through ``noxfile.py`` that explicitly allow change detection;
  * All ``lint`` sessions (``formatters``, ``codeqa``, ``yamllint``, ``typing``);
  * The ``extra-checks`` session and all its tests;
  * All tests but ``reuse`` from the ``license-check`` session;
  * The `docs-check` sessions are restricted to changed files (for code-block tests),
    or skipped if there are no appropriate changed files.

  Change detection can be enabled with the environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_CHANGE_DETECTION``.
  The base branch can explicitly set with the environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_BASE_BRANCH``
  (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/112,
  https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/120,

  https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/129,
  https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/130).
- In ``[sessions.lint]``, ``pylint_extra_deps`` and ``mypy_extra_deps`` can now use package type dictionaries like ``{type = "requirements", file = "requirements/mypy-extra-deps.txt"}`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/133).
- Make codecov upload for the shared nox workflow more flexible by allowing to disable it for specific event types (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/132).
- Provide a new shared workflow ``.github/workflows/reusable-nox-run`` that allows to run nox with change detection (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/128).
- The GitHub antsibull-nox action and the shared workflow support change detection.
  To enable change detection for PRs, simply set the workflow parameter ``change-detection-in-prs``
  to ``true``
  (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/112,
  https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/120,
  https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/121).
- antsibull-nox now depends on antsibull-fileutils >= 1.5.0
  (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/122).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- In ``[sessions.lint]``, shell splitting of strings in ``pylint_extra_deps`` and ``mypy_extra_deps`` is deprecated and will stop working in future releases. Use package type dictionaries instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/133).

v0.3.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature release that is stabilizing the API.

All noxfiles and configs using this version should still work with antsibull-nox 1.0.0,
unless a critical problem is found that cannot be solved in any other way.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add ``antsibull-nox init`` command that creates a ``noxfile.py`` and ``antsibull-nox.tomll`` to get started (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/58).
- Add ``callback_before`` and ``callback_after`` parameters to ``antsibull_nox.add_ansible_test_session()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/63).
- Add a ``antsibull-nox`` CLI tool with a subcommand ``lint-config`` that lints ``noxfile.py`` and the ``antsibull-nox.toml`` config file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/56).
- Add a session for linting the antsibull-nox configuration to ``lint`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/56).
- Add new options ``skip_tests``, ``allow_disabled``, and ``enable_optional_errors`` for ansible-test sanity sessions (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/61).
- Allow to disable coverage upload for specific integration test jobs in shared workflow with ``has-coverage=false`` in extra data (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/64).
- Ensure that Galaxy importer's output is actually collapsed on GHA (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/67).

- Update shared workflow to use a ``display-name`` and ``gha-container`` extra data (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/63).

Removed Features (previously deprecated)
----------------------------------------

- Removed all deprecated functions from ``antsibull_nox.**`` that generate sessions. The only functions left that are public API are ``antsibull_nox.load_antsibull_nox_toml()``, ``antsibull_nox.add_ansible_test_session()``, and ``antsibull_nox.sessions.prepare_collections()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/54).

Bugfixes
--------

- Action groups extra test no longer fails if ``action_groups`` does not exist in ``meta/runtime.yml``. It can now be used to ensure that there is no action group present in ``meta/runtime.yml`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/60).
- Do not fail when trying to install an empty list of packages when ``run_reuse=false`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/65).
- Make sure that ``extra_code_files`` is considered for ``black`` when ``run_black_modules=false`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/59).
- Make sure to flush stdout after calling ``print()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/67).

v0.2.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Major extension and overhaul with many breaking changes. The next minor release is expected to bring more stabilization.

Major Changes
-------------

- There is now a new function ``antsibull_nox.load_antsibull_nox_toml()`` which loads ``antsibull-nox.toml`` and creates configuration and sessions from it. Calling other functionality from ``antsibull_nox`` in ``noxfile.py`` is only necessary for creating own specialized sessions, or ansible-test sessions that cannot be created with the ``antsibull_nox.add_all_ansible_test_*_test_sessions*()`` type functions (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/50, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/34).

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add descriptions to generated sessions that are shown when running ``nox --list`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/31).
- Add function ``add_matrix_generator`` which allows to generate matrixes for CI systems for ansible-test runs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/32).
- Add several new functions to add ansible-test runs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/5, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/32, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/41, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/45).
- Add shared workflow for running ansible-test from nox and generating the CI matrix from nox as well (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/35, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/37, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/38, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/48, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/53).
- Allow to add ``yamllint`` session to ``lint`` meta-session that checks YAML files, and YAML content embedded in plugins and sidecar docs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/42).
- Allow to add ansible-lint session (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/40, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/49).
- Allow to disable using installed collections that are not checked out next to the current one by setting the environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_NOX_IGNORE_INSTALLED_COLLECTIONS`` to ``true`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/51).
- Collapse Galaxy importer's output in GitHub Actions (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/46).
- In the GitHub Action, no longer use installed collections, but only ones that have been checked out next to the current one. This avoids using collections that come with the Ansible community package installed in the default GHA image (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/51).
- The action allows to install additional Python versions with the new ``extra-python-versions`` option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/32).
- The action allows to pass extra commands after ``--`` with the new ``extra-args`` option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/32).
- antsibull-nox now automatically installs missing collections. It uses ``.nox/.cache`` to store the collection artifacts and the extracted collections (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/46, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/52, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/7).
- pydantic is now a required Python dependency of antsibull-nox (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/50).
- tomli is now a required Python dependency of antsibull-nox for Python versions 3.9 and 3.10 For Python 3.11+, the standard library tomllib will be used (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/50).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- All functions in ``antsibull_nox.**`` are deprecated except ``antsibull_nox.load_antsibull_nox_toml()``, ``antsibull_nox.add_ansible_test_session()``, and ``antsibull_nox.sessions.prepare_collections()``. The other function will still work for the next minor release, but will then be removed. Use ``antsibull-nox.toml`` and ``antsibull_nox.load_antsibull_nox_toml()`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/50).

v0.1.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- A ``build-import-check`` session that builds and tries to import the collection with Galaxy Importer can be added with ``add_build_import_check()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/15, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/17).
- A ``docs-check`` session that runs ``antsibull-docs lint-collection-docs`` can be added with ``add_docs_check()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/8, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
- A ``extra-checks`` session that runs extra checks such as ``no-unwanted-files`` or ``action-groups`` can be added with ``add_extra_checks()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/8, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
- A ``license-check`` session that runs ``reuse`` and checks for bad licenses can be added with ``add_license_check()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/8, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
- Allow to decide which sessions should be marked as default and which not (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/18, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/20).
- Allow to provide ``extra_code_files`` to ``add_lint_sessions()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
- Check whether we're running in CI using the generic ``$CI`` enviornment variable instead of ``$GITHUB_ACTIONS``. ``$CI`` is set to ``true`` on Github Actions, Gitlab CI, and other CI systems (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/28).
- For running pylint and mypy, copy the collection and dependent collections into a new tree. This allows the collection repository to be checked out outside an approriate tree structure, and it also allows the dependent collections to live in another tree structure, as long as ``ansible-galaxy collection list`` can find them (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/1).
- When a collection checkout is not part of an ``ansible_collections`` tree, look for collections in adjacent directories of the form ``<namespace>.<name>`` that match the containing collection's FQCN (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/6, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/22).
- antsibull-nox now depends on antsibull-fileutils >= 1.2.0 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/1).

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide

- The nox workflow now by default runs all sessions, unless restricted with the ``sessions`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).

Bugfixes
--------

- Make sure that black in CI checks formatting instead of just reformatting (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
