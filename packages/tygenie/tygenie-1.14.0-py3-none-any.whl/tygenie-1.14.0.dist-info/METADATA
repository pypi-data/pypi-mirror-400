           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Sample config

A sample config file is available [here](https://github.com/ovh/tygenie/blob/master/assets/tygenie.json)

<a name="plugin"></a>

## Plugin

Tygenie supports two type of customisation:

- Columns displayed in alerts (add/remove/rename) and content of each row (content is passed to a parser you might override)

- Content of alert description is also passed to parser and you might parse the content to change it before being displayed in Markdown

<a name="add-your-own-plugin"></a>

### Add your own plugin

1. In plugin directory add a directory with the name of your plugin, let's say 'Bob'
2. Depending what you want to customise:

- the alert list: add a file in Bob directory called 'alerts_list_formatter.py'
- content of alert description: add a file in Bob directory called 'alert_description_formatter.py'

<a name="customise-alert-list"></a>

#### Customise alert list

In file 'Bob/alerts_list_formatter.py'

```python

from rich.text import Text
from tygenie.alerts_list.formatter import BaseFormatter

# The class name must be the same as the plugin name
class Bob(BaseFormatter):
    # map method of the class with a column name
    # the dict is ordered so it will be displayed as it is declared
    # all the fields returned by the API are available by default
    displayed_fields = {
        "created_at": "Created",
        "status": "Status",
        "priority": "Priority",
        "region": "Region", # Custom field
        "message": "Message",
        "owner": "Owner",
        "closed_by": "Closed by",
    }

    # Let's add a custom field that we compute from the message
    # And return a rich Text object which allow us to customise the style
    def region(self, value) -> Text:
        m = re.match(r"^\[([^\[]+)\].*$", self.to_format["message"])
        region = ""
        if m and m.groups():
            region = m.group(1)
        return Text(region, style="#ffcf56")

    # Remove the region from the message as region is now a new column
    # And limit the length to 100 characters
    # And return a rich Text object with default style
    def message(self, value) -> Text:
        value = re.sub(r"^\[([^\[]+)\]\s*\:?\s*", "", value)
        if len(value) > 100:
            value = value[0:100] + "..."
        return Text(str(value))
```

Now the alert list has a new column called Region and the message does not contain any more the region string.

**Alert list with plugin**

<a name="customise-alert-description"></a>

#### Customise alert description

In file 'Bob/description_alert_formatter.py'

The alert description content might be customised in 2 steps:

- before the content has been passed to Markdown processor, useful to sanitize content
- after the content has been passed to Markdown processor, useful to customize output (create clickable links)

The plugin should inherit from **tygenie.alert_details.description_formatter.BaseContentFormatter**

This class expose an **_execution_order_** dictionary **{"pre": [], "post": []}** which allow you to pass a list of methods that will be called respecting the order you list them

The only thing you have to to is implement your custom method and list them in the execution_order dictionary

```python
import re
from tygenie.alert_details.description_formatter import BaseContentFormatter

class Bob(BaseContentFormatter):

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.execution_order["pre"] = [
            "pre_substitute_cariage_return_to_htmlttag",
        ]
        self.execution_order["post"] = [
            "post_custom_generate_url_by_id",
        ]

    # pre_substitute_* is a special form of method name that does the substitute for you
    # Just return a dict {"regexp": r"your regexp to match", "sub": r"the substitution"}
    def pre_substitute_cariage_return_to_htmlttag(self):
        return {"regexp": r"\r?\n", "sub": "<br>"}

    # Let's say your description return a list of ids you can easily find "#12345 #6789"
    # You would like to be able to click on that id to open a custom web interface that gives details on that id
    # And we want to do it after markdown processing
    def post_custom_generate_url_by_id(self):
        ids = re.findall( r"#(\d+)", self.content)
        url_base = 'https://www.corporate.com/mytool/details?id={id}'
        for id in set(ids):
            url = url_base.format(id=id)
            self.content = re.sub(
                f'#{id}', f"[#{id}]({url})", self.content
            )
```

### Enable the plugin

Edit the settings file then go to the plugins json key:

```json
{
  "tygenie": {
    "plugins": {
      "alerts_list_formatter": "Bob",
      "alert_description_formatter": "Bob"
    }
  }
}
```

## Opsgenie API / OpenAPI / python-client

The current Opsgenie API python SDK does not implement the full API and the available [swagger.json](https://github.com/opsgenie/opsgenie-oas/blob/master/swagger.json) file is not a Swagger 2.0 compliant file.

A fork of opsgenie-oas repository had been done by Github user [bougar](https://github.com/bougar/opsgenie-oas) which contains a compliant Swagger 2.0 files. This file has been used to generate the Opsgenie client API consumer used in Tygenie.

The swagger file has been converted to openapi 3.0 and consumed by [openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client)
