Pipe based dataframe manipulation library that can also transform data on SQL databases

This is an early stage version 0.x, however, it is already used in real projects. We are happy to receive your
feedback as [issues](https://github.com/pydiverse/pydiverse.transform/issues) on the GitHub repo. Feel free to also
comment on existing issues to extend them to your needs or to add solution ideas.

## Usage

pydiverse.transform can either be installed via pypi with `pip install pydiverse-transform` or via conda-forge
with `conda install pydiverse-transform -c conda-forge`. Our recommendation would be
to use [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) which is also based on conda-forge:

```bash
mkdir my_project
pixi init
pixi add pydiverse-transform
```

With pixi, you run python like this:

```bash
pixi run python -c 'import pydiverse.transform'
```

or this:

```bash
pixi run python my_script.py
```

## Example

This code illustrates how to use pydiverse.transform with pandas and SQL:

```python
from pydiverse.transform import Table
from pydiverse.transform.lazy import SQLTableImpl
from pydiverse.transform.eager import PandasTableImpl
from pydiverse.transform.core.verbs import *
import pandas as pd
import sqlalchemy as sqa


def main():
    dfA = pd.DataFrame(
        {
            "x": [1],
            "y": [2],
        }
    )
    dfB = pd.DataFrame(
        {
            "a": [2, 1, 0, 1],
            "x": [1, 1, 2, 2],
        }
    )

    input1 = Table(PandasTableImpl("dfA", dfA))
    input2 = Table(PandasTableImpl("dfB", dfB))

    transform = (
        input1
        >> left_join(input2 >> select(), input1.x == input2.x)
        >> mutate(x5=input1.x * 5, a=input2.a)
    )
    out1 = transform >> collect()
    print("\nPandas based result:")
    print(out1)

    engine = sqa.create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:")
    dfA.to_sql("dfA", engine, index=False, if_exists="replace")
    dfB.to_sql("dfB", engine, index=False, if_exists="replace")
    input1 = Table(SQLTableImpl(engine, "dfA"))
    input2 = Table(SQLTableImpl(engine, "dfB"))
    transform = (
        input1
        >> left_join(input2 >> select(), input1.x == input2.x)
        >> mutate(x5=input1.x * 5, a=input2.a)
    )
    out2 = transform >> collect()
    print("\nSQL query:")
    print(transform >> build_query())
    print("\nSQL based result:")
    print(out2)

    out1 = out1.sort_values("a").reset_index(drop=True)
    out2 = out2.sort_values("a").reset_index(drop=True)
    assert len(out1.compare(out2)) == 0


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
