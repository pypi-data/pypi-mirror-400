      "answer": "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\n\nThis definition is foundational because it precisely captures the three essential components of any learning system:\n\n1. **Experience (E)**: The data or interactions from which the system learns. This could be labeled examples (supervised learning), unlabeled data patterns (unsupervised learning), or feedback from actions (reinforcement learning).\n\n2. **Task (T)**: What the system is trying to accomplish. Examples include classification (assigning labels to inputs), regression (predicting continuous values), clustering (grouping similar items), anomaly detection, and many others.\n\n3. **Performance Measure (P)**: How we evaluate whether learning has occurred. For classification, this might be accuracy or F1-score. For regression, mean squared error. The choice of measure significantly influences what the algorithm optimizes for.\n\nWithout all three components clearly defined, we cannot rigorously claim that a system is 'learning' versus simply being programmed with fixed rules.",
