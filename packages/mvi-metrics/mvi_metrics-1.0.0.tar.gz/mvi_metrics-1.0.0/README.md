# mvi-metrics

**mvi-metrics** provides a simple, practical implementation of a *Memory Vulnerability Index (MVI)* for PyTorch models.  
It helps estimate which batches or samples are most vulnerable (likely to be forgotten) in continual learning settings.

## Install
```bash
pip install mvi-metrics
