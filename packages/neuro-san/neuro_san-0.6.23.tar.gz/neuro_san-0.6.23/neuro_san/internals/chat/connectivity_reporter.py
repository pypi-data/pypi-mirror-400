class ConnectivityReporter:
    """
    A class that knows how to report the connectivity of an entire AgentNetwork.

    Connectivity information comes as a series of AgentFramework
    messages, each of whose origin field reflects the name of the
    node and the content of the message is a JSON structure
    containing the list of tools that the node is connected to.

    *   The FrontMan is always sent first.
    *   Subsequent tool reporting proceeds in a breadth-first search, as per the
        ordering of the tools laid out in each agent spec.
    *   Cycles in the graph are mentioned in the tool reporting, but any node
        is only ever reported once.
    *   Hocon files can elect to hide the connectivity information from this reporting
        from any level on downstream by adding this block:
            "allow": {
                "connectivity": False
            }
        ...so if a network does not want connectivity reported at all, then this is only
        required in the front man's spec.
        Such a node will itself be reported, but with an empty tool list.
    *   External agents are reported but with an empty tool list.
        No effort to discover their internal connectivity is attempted.
        Maybe someday.
