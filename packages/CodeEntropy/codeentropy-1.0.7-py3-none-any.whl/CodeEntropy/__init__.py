CodeEntropy

CodeEntropy is a Python package for computing the configurational entropy of
macromolecular systems using forces sampled from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
It implements the multiscale cell correlation method to provide accurate and efficient
entropy estimates, supporting a wide range of applications in molecular simulation
and statistical mechanics.
