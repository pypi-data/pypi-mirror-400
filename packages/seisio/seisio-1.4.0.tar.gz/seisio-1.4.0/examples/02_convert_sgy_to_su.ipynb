    "Let's convert the file in steps rather than reading the whole file at once. We would like to remap the input trace header mnemonic `fldr` to the trace header mnemonic `cdp` in the output (this would not normally make sense, we just do it to demonstrate the remapping itself). For each batch we read and convert, we also set the `scalel` and `scalco` trace headers (providing information on elevation and coordinate scalers) to zero. As SEG-Y has different trace headers compared to SU, you will see a few warnings that certain headers need to be dropped because there is no equivalent header mnemonic in the SU header definition. This could be avoided by remapping the corresponding headers to trace header mnemonics available in the SU world, or providing a non-standard SU trace header definition table (JSON file) when creating the output object."
