## Prompts

1. Create a changelog folder with a file called 0.0.1-0.0.2.md and document changes in there. Be very indepth in the change log but the readme can be a basic update. This read me is for 0.0.1 

2. Another additional tinker I want to have is with the decorator versioning system. Right now it will allow an unversioned request but add a tinker that makes this strict and requires a version
