# **Example**: Splitting Files by Semantic Similarity using `SemanticSplitter`

![Semantic splitting illustration](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.13070v1/extracted/5932831/images/chunkers.png)

For some documents, the best splitting strategy is to break them at **semantic boundaries** rather than fixed lengths or pages. This is exactly what the [**`SemanticSplitter`**](../../api_reference/splitter.md#semanticsplitter) does, which uses **cosine similarity** to detect topic or meaning shifts between sentences. This allows to produce semantically coherent chunks.

In this example, we will read the famous **Pinocchio** tale ([`pinocchio_example.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR/refs/heads/main/data/pinocchio_example.md)) using [`VanillaReader`](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/reader/#vanillareader), and then split it into chunks using [**`SemanticSplitter`**](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/splitter/#semanticsplitter).

## Step 1. Read the file

You can read the file using `VanillaReader` or any other [`Reader`](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/reader/) that outputs a [`ReaderOutput` object](../../api_reference/reader.md#output-format).


```python
from splitter_mr.reader import VanillaReader

FILE_PATH = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR/refs/heads/main/data/pinocchio_example.md"

reader = VanillaReader()
reader_output = reader.read(file_path=FILE_PATH)
```


The output will look like:


```python
print(reader_output.model_dump_json(indent=4))
```

    {
        "text": "# Pinocchio by Carlo Colodi (*The Tale of a Puppet*)\n\n## Chapter 1\n\n### THE PIECE OF WOOD THAT LAUGHED AND CRIED LIKE A CHILD\n\nThere was once upon a time a piece of wood in the shop of an old carpenter named Master Antonio.

        "document_name": "pinocchio_example.md",
        "document_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR/refs/heads/main/data/pinocchio_example.md",
        "document_id": "9ad18596-3dbc-49ba-b428-fbd2db3fd7f4",
        "conversion_method": "txt",
        "reader_method": "vanilla",
        "ocr_method": null,
        "page_placeholder": null,
        "metadata": {}
    }



Note that this is a Pydantic object, so you can represent it as a JSON dictionary with the `.model_dump_json()` instruction.

## Step 2. Split by semantic similarity

To split semantically, instantiate the [`SemanticSplitter`](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/splitter/#semanticsplitter) object with an [embedding backend](../../api_reference/embedding.md#embedders) and call to the `.split()` method:


```python
from splitter_mr.embedding import (
    AzureOpenAIEmbedding,
)  # can be any other Embedding model.
from splitter_mr.splitter import SemanticSplitter
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv

params = {
    "model_name": os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING"),
    "api_key": os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    "azure_deployment": os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_EMBEDDING"),
    "api_version": os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
}

embedding = AzureOpenAIEmbedding(**params)  # can be any other Embedding model.

splitter = SemanticSplitter(embedding)
splitter_output = splitter.split(reader_output)

for idx, chunk in enumerate(splitter_output.chunks):
    print("\n" + "*" * 80 + f" Chunk {idx} " + "*" * 80 + "\n")
    print(chunk)
```

Geppetto carried off his fine piece of wood and, thanking Master Antonio, returned limping to his house.



## How it works

The **SemanticSplitter** algorithm:

1. **Sentence Splitting** — Breaks text into individual sentences using [`SentenceSplitter`](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/splitter/#sentencesplitter).
2. **Sliding Window Context** — Combines each sentence with `buffer_size` neighbors before and after for better semantic representation.
3. **Embedding Generation** — Uses the provided [`BaseEmbedding`](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/embedding#baseembedding) model to get vector representations of each combined sentence.
4. **Distance Calculation** — Computes **cosine distances** between consecutive embeddings.
5. **Breakpoint Detection** — Finds points where the distance exceeds a threshold (based on percentile, standard deviation, interquartile range, or gradient).
6. **Chunk Assembly** — Merges sentences between breakpoints into chunks, ensuring each meets the minimum `chunk_size`.

To consult information more-in-depth about how this algorithm works, you can check the following [**section**](#annex-semantic-splitting-algorithm).

## Customizing Parameters

You can adjust how chunks are detected and their minimum length:


```python
splitter = SemanticSplitter(
    embedding=embedding,
    buffer_size=1,  # number of neighbor sentences to include
    breakpoint_threshold_type="percentile",  # method for determining breakpoints
    breakpoint_threshold_amount=80.0,  # threshold value (percentile here)
    chunk_size=1000,  # minimum characters per chunk
)
splitter_output = splitter.split(reader_output)
print(splitter_output.model_dump_json(indent=4))
```

    {
        "chunks": [
            "# Pinocchio by Carlo Colodi (*The Tale of a Puppet*)\n\n## Chapter 1\n\n### THE PIECE OF WOOD THAT LAUGHED AND CRIED LIKE A CHILD\n\nThere was once upon a time a piece of wood in the shop of an old carpenter named Master Antonio.

    in/data/pinocchio_example.md",
        "document_id": "9ad18596-3dbc-49ba-b428-fbd2db3fd7f4",
        "conversion_method": "txt",
        "reader_method": "vanilla",
        "ocr_method": null,
        "split_method": "semantic_splitter",
        "split_params": {
            "buffer_size": 1,
            "breakpoint_threshold_type": "percentile",
            "breakpoint_threshold_amount": 80.0,
            "number_of_chunks": null,
            "chunk_size": 1000,
            "model_name": "text-embedding-3-large"
        },
        "metadata": {}
    }



In this case, more chunks are extracted since the splitter becomes more sensitive to smaller semantic changes.

Other available [`breakpoint_threshold_type`](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/splitter/#splitter_mr.splitter.splitters.semantic_splitter.SemanticSplitter) values are:

- `"percentile"` — Split at distances above a given percentile.
- `"standard_deviation"` — Split at mean + (amount × std deviation).
- `"interquartile"` — Split at mean + (amount × IQR).
- `"gradient"` — Split at steep changes in distance.

Alternatively, you can also directly control the **number of chunks** by setting `number_of_chunks`.

## Annex: Semantic Splitting algorithm

The Semantic Splitter detects **semantic shift points** between adjacent sentence windows by:

1. Splitting the text into sentences.
2. Creating a **sliding window** around each sentence (`buffer_size` neighbors on both sides).
3. Embedding each window with the configured `BaseEmbedding`.
4. Computing **cosine distances** between consecutive windows.
5. Selecting **breakpoints** where the signal exceeds a threshold (or meets a desired number of chunks).
6. Emitting chunks between breakpoints, honoring a **minimum** `chunk_size` (in characters).

Below, the full process will be detailed.

### Notation

- Let the document be split into sentences \( S = [s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_{n-1}] \).

- For each index \( i \), define a **window** \( w_i \) as the concatenation of sentences

  $$
  w_i = \text{concat}\big(s_{\max(0,\, i-b)}, \ldots, s_i, \ldots, s_{\min(n-1,\, i+b)}\big),
  $$
  where \( b = \texttt{buffer\_size} \).

- Let \( \mathbf{e}_i = \text{embed}(w_i) \in \mathbb{R}^d \) be the embedding vector.

- Define **cosine similarity** and **distance**:

$$\text{cos\_sim}(\mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{e}_{i+1})= \frac{\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{e}_{i+1}}{\lVert \mathbf{e}_i \rVert \, \lVert \mathbf{e}_{i+1} \rVert + \varepsilon}, \qquad d_i = 1 - \operatorname{cos\_sim}(\mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{e}_{i+1}),$$

  with a small \( \varepsilon \) for numerical stability.

We obtain a distance vector \( D = [d_0, d_1, \ldots, d_{n-2}] \) (length \( n-1 \)).


### Breakpoint Selection

Let $ R $ be the **reference array** used to select cut indices:
- For most strategies, $ R = D $.
- For `"gradient"`, compute $ G = \nabla D $ and set $ R = G $.

We then choose a **threshold** $ T $ and mark **breakpoints** at all indices $ i $ where $ R[i] > T $.

#### Threshold Strategies

**Percentile** (default):

  - $ T = \text{percentile}(D, p) $, where $ p \in [0, 100] $.
  - Intuition: cut at the largest $ (100 - p)\% $ jumps.

**Standard Deviation**:

   - $ \mu = \text{mean}(D),\ \sigma = \text{std}(D) $
   - $ T = \mu + \alpha \sigma $ (e.g., $ \alpha=3 $).
   - Intuition: cut on statistical outliers.

**Interquartile (IQR)**:

   - $ Q_1, Q_3 = \text{percentile}(D, 25), \text{percentile}(D, 75) $
   - $ \text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1,\ \mu = \text{mean}(D) $
   - $ T = \mu + \beta \cdot \text{IQR} $ (e.g., $ \beta=1.5 $).
   - Intuition: robust outlier detection vs. heavy tails.

**Gradient**:

   - Compute $ G = \nabla D $ and threshold by percentile on $ G $:
     $ T = \text{percentile}(G, p) $.
   - **Intuition**: cut at steep **changes** in the distance signal (useful when distances drift).

!!! note
    For `"percentile"` and `"gradient"`, the class accepts `breakpoint_threshold_amount` in either $[0, 1]$ (interpreted as a fraction, converted internally to $[0,100]$) or $[0,100]$ (as a percentile). For `"standard_deviation"` and `"interquartile"`, the amount is a **multiplier** ($\alpha$ or $\beta$).

### Targeting a Desired Number of Chunks

If `number_of_chunks` is set, the splitter **maps** the requested count to an **inverse percentile** over $ D $:

- Let $ m = |D| $. Requested chunks $ k $ are mapped to a percentile $ y \in [0,100] $ such that:

  - $ k=1 \Rightarrow y \approx 100 $ (almost no cuts),
  - $ k=m \Rightarrow y \approx 0 $ (many cuts).

- The threshold is then $ T = \text{percentile}(D, y) $.

This provides an approximate, monotonic control over chunk count without explicit clustering.

### Chunk Assembly and `chunk_size` Enforcement

After computing indices $ \mathcal{B} = \{i \mid R[i] > T\} $, we sweep left-to-right:

1. Maintain a `start_idx` (initially 0).
2. For each $ i \in \mathcal{B} $ in ascending order, propose a cut **after** sentence $ i $ (i.e., up to index $ i $ inclusive).
3. Build the candidate chunk $ C = \text{concat}(s_{\text{start}}, \ldots, s_{i}) $.
4. If `len(C) >= chunk_size`, **emit** the chunk and set `start_idx = i + 1`.
5. After the sweep, **emit the tail** (if non-empty).

If no candidate passes `chunk_size`, the splitter **falls back** to a single chunk (all sentences concatenated).

> `chunk_size` is a **minimum** only. Chunks can be **larger** depending on where valid cut points occur.
