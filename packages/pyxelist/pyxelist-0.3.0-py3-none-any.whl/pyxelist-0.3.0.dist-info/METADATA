# PyxelList

**PyxelList** is a small Python library for creating and drawing grid-based graphics using the standard `turtle` module.  
It allows you to display 2D grids, move them around, and even handle simple frame-based animations—all in pure Python with no external dependencies.

---

## Features

- Draw solid or animated grids using turtle.
- Easily position grids anywhere on the screen.
- Set or move grids along `x`, `y`, or both axes.
- Handle simple transparency using `"#======"` in grid data.
- Works with Python’s built-in `turtle`—no additional libraries required.

## Installation

You can install PyxelList (once it’s published on PyPI) using:

```bash
pip install pyxelist
