# First Steps

This section introduces the basic usage of the EasyDiffraction Python API.
You'll learn how to import the package, use core classes and utility functions,
and access built-in helper methods to streamline diffraction data analysis
workflows.

## Importing EasyDiffraction

### Importing the entire package

To start using EasyDiffraction, first import the package in your Python script
or Jupyter Notebook. This can be done with the following command:

```python
import easydiffraction
```

Alternatively, you can import it with an alias to avoid naming conflicts and for
convenience:

```python
import easydiffraction as ed
```

The latter syntax allows you to access all the modules and classes within the
package using the `ed` prefix. For example, you can create a project instance
like this:

```python
project = ed.Project()
```

A complete tutorial using the `import` syntax can be found
[here](../../tutorials/ed-3/).

### Importing specific parts

Alternatively, you can import specific classes or methods from the package. For
example, you can import the `Project`, `SampleModel`, `Experiment` classes and
`download_from_repository` method like this:

```python
from easydiffraction import (
    Project,
    SampleModel,
    Experiment,
    download_from_repository
)
```

This enables you to use these classes and methods directly without the package
prefix. This is especially useful when you're using only a few components and
want to keep your code clean and concise. In this case, you can create a project
instance like this:

```python
project = Project()
```

A complete tutorial using the `from` syntax can be found
[here](../../tutorials/ed-4/).

## Utility functions

EasyDiffraction also provides several utility functions that can simplify your
workflow. One of them is the `download_from_repository` function, which allows
you to download data files from our remote repository, making it easy to access
and use them while experimenting with EasyDiffraction.

For example, you can download a sample data file like this:

```python
import easydiffraction as ed

ed.download_from_repository('hrpt_lbco.xye',
                            branch='docs',
                            destination='data')
```

This command will download the `hrpt_lbco.xye` file from the `docs` branch of
the EasyDiffraction repository and save it in the `data` directory of your
current working directory. This is particularly useful for quickly accessing
example datasets without having to manually download them.

## Help methods

EasyDiffraction provides several helper methods to display supported engines for
calculation, minimization, and plotting. These methods can be called on the
`Project` instance to display the available options for different categories.

### Supported calculators

For example, you can use the `show_supported_calculators()` method to see which
calculation engines are available for use in your project:

```python
project.show_supported_calculators()
```

This will display a list of supported calculators along with their descriptions,
allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs.

An example of the output for the `show_supported_calculators()` method is:

| Calculator | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| cryspy     | CrysPy library for crystallographic calculations            |
| pdffit     | PDFfit2 library for pair distribution function calculations |

### Supported minimizers

You can also check the available minimizers using the
`show_available_minimizers()` method:

```python
project.show_available_minimizers()
```

### Available parameters

EasyDiffraction provides several methods for showing the available parameters
grouped in different categories. For example, you can use:

- `project.analysis.show_all_params()` – to display all available parameters for
  the analysis step.
- `project.analysis.show_fittable_params()` – to display only the parameters
  that can be fitted during the analysis.
- `project.analysis.show_free_params()` – to display the parameters that are
  currently free to be adjusted during the fitting process.

Finally, you can use the `project.analysis.how_to_access_parameters()` method to
get a brief overview of how to access and modify parameters in the analysis
step, along with their unique identifiers in the CIF format. This can be
particularly useful for users who are new to the EasyDiffraction API or those
who want to quickly understand how to work with parameters in their projects.

An example of the output for the `project.analysis.how_to_access_parameters()`
method is:

|     | Code variable                                          | Unique ID for CIF                |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 1   | project.sample_models['lbco'].atom_site['La'].adp_type | lbco.atom_site.La.ADP_type       |
| 2   | project.sample_models['lbco'].atom_site['La'].b_iso    | lbco.atom_site.La.B_iso_or_equiv |
| 3   | project.sample_models['lbco'].atom_site['La'].fract_x  | lbco.atom_site.La.fract_x        |
| 4   | project.sample_models['lbco'].atom_site['La'].fract_y  | lbco.atom_site.La.fract_y        |
| ... | ...                                                    | ...                              |
| 59  | project.experiments['hrpt'].peak.broad_gauss_u         | hrpt.peak.broad_gauss_u          |
| 60  | project.experiments['hrpt'].peak.broad_gauss_v         | hrpt.peak.broad_gauss_v          |
| 61  | project.experiments['hrpt'].peak.broad_gauss_w         | hrpt.peak.broad_gauss_w          |

### Supported plotters

To see the available plotters, you can use the `show_available_plotters()`
method on the `plotter` attribute of the `Project` instance:

```python
project.plotter.show_supported_engines()
```

An example of the output is:

| Engine       | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| asciichartpy | Console ASCII line charts                  |
| plotly       | Interactive browser-based graphing library |

## Data analysis workflow

Once the EasyDiffraction package is imported, you can proceed with the **data
analysis**. This step can be split into several sub-steps, such as creating a
project, defining sample models, adding experimental data, etc.

EasyDiffraction provides a **Python API** that allows you to perform these steps
programmatically in a certain linear order. This is especially useful for users
who prefer to work in a script or Jupyter Notebook environment. The API is
designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing you to focus on the analysis
rather than low-level implementation details.

Because this workflow is an important part of the EasyDiffraction package, it is
described in detail in the separate
[Analysis Workflow](analysis-workflow/index.md) section of the documentation.
