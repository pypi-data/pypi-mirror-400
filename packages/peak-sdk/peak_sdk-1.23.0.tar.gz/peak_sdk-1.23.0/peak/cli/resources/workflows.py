    """***Update*** an existing workflow.

    \b
    This command allows to efficiently modify trigger details, watchers, workflow name, and specific step attributes such as repository URL, branch, token, image ID, version ID etc.

    \b
    By specifying step_names, we can globally update specified steps with provided parameters, streamlining the update process. If step_names is not provided, all the steps for that workflow would be updated.

    \b
    Alternatively, we can selectively modify individual step attributes across different steps by providing the details in the yaml file. With this, we can also add new steps to the workflow by providing the parameters required by the step.

    \b
    If both body and specific parameters are used, the latter takes precedence.
