# qdiv: Microbial Diversity Analysis Toolkit

**qdiv** is a Python toolkit for microbial diversity analysis, built around the robust and intuitive Hill number framework.

---

## Features
- Data Management: Load and validate data from multiple formats (CSV/TSV, FASTA, Newick). Functions for subsetting, rarefaction, merging, renaming, tree pruning, and more.

- Diversity analysis: Compute multiple alpha and beta diversity metrics based on the Hill number framework.

- Statistical methods: Integrate diversity metrics using the Hill number framework into null models (Raup–Crick, NRI, NTI), ordinations (PCoA, db-RDA), PERMANOVA, and Mantel tests.

- Visualization: Heatmaps, ordinations, and diversity plots, and more.
