Task: {{ instruction }}
Input Item: "{{ item }}"

Step 1: Identify the unit of the Input Item (e.g., "$", "kg", "C").
Step 2: Identify the target unit from the Task.
Step 3: CRITICAL: If the units are physically the same
(e.g., Input is USD and Target is USD), DO NOT MULTIPLY.
The value must remain unchanged.
Step 4: Only apply conversion formulas if units are different (e.g., EUR to USD).
Step 5: Output JSON with keys "reasoning", "value", and "unit".
