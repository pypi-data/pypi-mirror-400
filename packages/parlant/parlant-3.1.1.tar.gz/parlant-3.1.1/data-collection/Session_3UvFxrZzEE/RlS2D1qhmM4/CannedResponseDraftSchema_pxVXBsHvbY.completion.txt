  "response_body": "To calibrate your spaceship's thrusters, you'll need to follow a step-by-step process: First, ensure the ship is powered down and in a safe environment. Next, access the thruster control panel and run the diagnostic mode. The system will prompt you to adjust each thruster's output to match the baseline values. Make small adjustments as needed, and confirm each setting. Once all thrusters are within the recommended range, save the calibration and restart the ship to complete the process."
