# EasyPV

EasyPV is a Python tool designed for statistical analysis. It facilitates the organization and analysis of monitoring data exported from the National Medical Device Adverse Event Information System, the National Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring System, and the National Cosmetic Adverse Reaction Monitoring System. EasyPV provides functionalities such as data import, data viewing, basic statistical analysis, signal detection, and report generation.

## Features

Data Import and Export: Supports multiple data formats for import and export.
Basic Statistical Analysis: Includes statistics by city/county, reporting units, manufacturers, and products.
Signal Detection: Detects new adverse reaction signals through data mining algorithms.
Report Generation: Quickly generates various statistical reports and charts.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive operation.


## Data Files and Extension Libraries
EasyPV relies on several data files and extension libraries to function properly. These files contain configuration data and compiled modules that are essential for the program's operation. The following files are included with the program: sor.zip,def.zip,easypv.so/easypv.pyd,easystat.so/easystat.pyd,adrmdr.so/adrmdr.pyd, and pinggutools.so/pinggutools.pyd.
These files are integral to the functionality of EasyPV and must be present in the appropriate directories for the program to operate correctly.
Some of the database files included in the above archives are encrypted to ensure data security and integrity. However, EasyPV is designed to automatically decrypt these files during runtime, so no manual intervention is required. The decryption process is seamless and ensures that the program can access the necessary data without compromising security.
Important Note: The data files provided during installation are essentially blank. Upon the first launch of the program, EasyPV will download updates from a third-party source to populate these files. You must accept this download and update process to use the software.

## Installation

You can install EasyPV via PyPI:

pip install easypv
