class DStabilityAnalysis(ExternalProgram):
    """
    DStabilityAnalysis can be used to perform an analysis using D-Stability on a third-party worker. To
    start an analysis call the method :meth:`~.ExternalProgram.execute`, with an appropriate timeout (in seconds).
    To retrieve the results call the method :meth:`get_output_file`, after :meth:`~.ExternalProgram.execute`.

    Example usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        file = File()  # create a writable File object
        path = Path(file.source)  # request its path
        dstability_model.serialize(path)  # let GEOLIB write to the file
        analysis = DStabilityAnalysis(input_file=file)  # pass the file with content to DStabilityAnalysis
        analysis.execute(timeout=10)
        output_file = analysis.get_output_file()

    Exceptions which can be raised during calculation:
    - :class:`viktor.errors.ExecutionError`: generic error. Error message provides more information
