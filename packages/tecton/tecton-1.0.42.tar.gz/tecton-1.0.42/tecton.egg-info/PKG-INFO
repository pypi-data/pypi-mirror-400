Tecton is the fastest way to build operational machine learning applications. It helps automate real-time decision making like fraud detection, product recommendations, and search result ranking in production applications.

Tecton is a fully-managed feature platform built to orchestrate the complete lifecycle of features, from transformation to online serving, with enterprise-grade SLAs.

With Tecton, you can:

- Define and manage features using code in a git repository.
- Automatically compute and orchestrate batch, streaming, and real-time feature
  transformations.
- Store and serve feature data for training and inference.
- Share, discover, and manage access to features.

# Contents of the `tecton` PyPI package

The `tecton` PyPI package bundles Tecton's Python SDK, which is used for defining and testing feature pipelines and services, and generating datasets for training and batch inference. For more information, see the [SDK reference](https://docs.tecton.ai/api-reference/index.html).
