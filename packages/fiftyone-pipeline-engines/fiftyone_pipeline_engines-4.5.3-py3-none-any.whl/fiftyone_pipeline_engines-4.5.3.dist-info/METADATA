## Introduction

The Pipeline is a generic web request intelligence and data processing solution with the ability to add a range of 51Degrees and/or custom plug ins (Engines) 

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+

* An auto-updating data file for properties
* A service called when a requested property
* A caching system and implementation of an LRU (least recently used) cache
