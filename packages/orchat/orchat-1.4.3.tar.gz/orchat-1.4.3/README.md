## 🎨 Themes

<details>
<summary><strong>🎨 Available Themes</strong></summary>

Change the visual appearance with the `/theme` command:

- **default**: Blue user, green assistant
- **dark**: Cyan user, magenta assistant
- **light**: Blue user, green assistant with lighter colors
- **hacker**: Matrix-inspired green text on black

</details>

## 📊 Token Management

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Smart Context Management</strong></summary>

OrChat intelligently manages conversation context to keep within token limits:

- **Auto-Summarization** (NEW): Instead of simply trimming old messages, OrChat uses AI to create concise summaries of earlier conversation parts, preserving important context while freeing up tokens
- **Configurable Threshold**: Set when summarization kicks in (default: 70% of token limit)
- **Fallback Trimming**: If summarization is disabled or fails, automatically trims old messages
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear notifications when messages are summarized or trimmed
- Displays comprehensive token usage statistics including total tokens and cost tracking
- Shows real-time pricing information during active sessions
- Displays total cost tracking across conversations
- Allows manual clearing of context with `/clear`
- Toggle auto-summarization with `/auto-summarize` command

**How it works:**
- When your conversation approaches the token limit (default: 70%), OrChat automatically summarizes the oldest messages
- The summary preserves key information, decisions, and context in a condensed form
- Recent messages are kept in full to maintain conversation flow
- You can disable this feature and revert to simple trimming with `/auto-summarize`

</details>

## 🔄 Updates

<details>
<summary><strong>🔄 Version Management</strong></summary>

Check for updates with the `/update` command to see if a newer version is available.

</details>



<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
## 🔍 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>🔍 Common Issues & Solutions</strong></summary>

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your OpenRouter API key is correctly set in config.ini, .env file, or system environment variables. OrChat will prompt for re-entry if an incorrect key is detected
- **Insufficient Account Credit**: If you receive a 402 error, check your OpenRouter account balance and add funds as needed
- **File Path Problems**: When using `/attach` or `/upload`, use quotes for paths with spaces and ensure correct path format for your OS
- **Model Compatibility**: Some features like thinking mode only work with specific models
- **Conversation Management**: Use `/chat list` to see saved conversations, `/chat save` to save current session, and `/chat resume <name>` to continue previous conversations
- **Command Usage**: Remember that `/upload` and `/attach` can be used anywhere in your message for flexibility
