# Litelines: Structured LLM Generation

## What is Litelines?

Litelines is a lightweight Python library designed for structured generation with Large Language Models (LLMs), featuring powerful visualization capabilities to inspect and understand state transitions during the generation process.

## Key Features

- **Structured Generation**: Control and guide LLM outputs with predefined structures and constraints
- **State Transition Visualization**: Interactive visual tools to monitor and analyze how your LLM progresses through different generation states
- **Lightweight Design**: Minimal dependencies and efficient performance for seamless integration
- **Developer-Friendly**: Intuitive API designed for both research and production environments
- **Debugging & Inspection**: Deep insights into LLM behavior through comprehensive state tracking

## Why Choose Litelines?

Litelines bridges the gap between raw LLM capabilities and structured, predictable outputs. Whether you're building conversational AI, content generation systems, or research tools, Litelines provides the transparency and control needed to understand and optimize your LLM's decision-making process.

Perfect for developers who need to:

- Debug complex LLM generation workflows
- Ensure consistent, structured outputs
- Visualize and analyze model behavior
