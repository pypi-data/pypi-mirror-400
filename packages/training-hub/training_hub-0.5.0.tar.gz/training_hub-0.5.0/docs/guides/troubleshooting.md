# Troubleshooting Guide

> **Note:** This guide is currently minimal and will be expanded based on user feedback and interest. If you encounter issues not covered here or need more detailed troubleshooting steps, please [open an issue](https://github.com/instructlab/training-hub/issues).

## Overview

This guide covers common issues and troubleshooting steps for Training Hub. For algorithm-specific issues, see the documentation for [SFT](/algorithms/sft) or [OSFT](/algorithms/osft).

## Topics

### Installation Issues

**TBD** - Common installation problems, dependency conflicts, environment setup issues, and platform-specific installation guidance.

### GPU and CUDA Issues

**TBD** - GPU not detected, CUDA version mismatches, out-of-memory errors, and multi-GPU configuration problems.

### Data Format Errors

**TBD** - JSONL parsing errors, invalid message structure, encoding issues, and data validation failures.

### Training Failures

**TBD** - Training crashes, NaN losses, gradient issues, and checkpoint corruption.

### Determining Model Convergence

**TBD** - How to monitor training progress, interpret loss curves, evaluate model performance, and decide when to stop training.

### Distributed Training Issues

**TBD** - Multi-GPU synchronization problems, multi-node connection failures, rendezvous timeout errors, and uneven GPU utilization.

### Performance and Speed Issues

**TBD** - Slow training speed, inefficient GPU utilization, memory bottlenecks, and optimization tips.

### Configuration and Parameter Issues

**TBD** - Invalid parameter combinations, backend compatibility issues, and parameter tuning guidance.
