This is a collection of examples where Tesseract is integrated with [Ansys products](https://www.ansys.com/) in various ways.

The Ansys software suite is heavily used throughout the engineering simulation industry. Wrapping Ansys products as Tesseracts allows you to embed them into Tesseract-driven compute pipelines --- acting as poweful data generators, differentiable solvers, geometry engines, and more.

```{seealso}
You can find the code for all Ansys Tesseracts in the `demo/_showcase` directory of the [Tesseract Core repository](https://github.com/pasteurlabs/tesseract-core/tree/main/demo/_showcase).

:::{grid-item-card} SpaceClaim
:link: ansys_integration/spaceclaim_tess.html

      A Tesseract that wraps SpaceClaim for CAD geometry creation.

:::
:::{grid-item-card} MAPDL
:link: ansys_integration/pymapdl_tess.html

      A differentiable Tesseract that wraps the MAPDL solver via PyMAPDL with an analytic adjoint, for use in SIMP topology optimization.
