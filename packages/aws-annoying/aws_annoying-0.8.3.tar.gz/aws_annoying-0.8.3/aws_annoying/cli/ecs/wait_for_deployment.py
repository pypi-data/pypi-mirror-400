    It's designed to be used after triggering a deployment (e.g., updating service, deploying new task definition),
    in conjunction with CI/CD pipelines or deployment scripts.

    Below is an example of using this command in GitHub Actions workflow:

    ```yaml
      ...

      - name: Deploy to ECS service
        id: deploy-ecs
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v2
        with:
          task-definition: ${{ steps.render-task-definition.outputs.task-definition }}
          cluster: ${{ vars.AWS_ECS_CLUSTER }}
          service: ${{ vars.AWS_ECS_SERVICE }}
          wait-for-service-stability: false

      - name: Wait for deployment complete
        run: |
          pipx run aws-annoying \
            --verbose \
            ecs wait-for-deployment \
              --cluster '${{ vars.AWS_ECS_CLUSTER }}' \

              --expected-task-definition '${{ steps.deploy-ecs.outputs.task-definition-arn }}'

      ...
    ```

    `--wait-for-start` is necessary because there could be no deployment right after the deploy action.
