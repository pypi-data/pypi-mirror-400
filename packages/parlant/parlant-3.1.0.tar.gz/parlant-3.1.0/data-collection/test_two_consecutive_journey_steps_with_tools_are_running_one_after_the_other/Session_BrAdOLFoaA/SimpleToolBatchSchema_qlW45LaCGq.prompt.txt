GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
You are part of a system of AI agents which interact with a customer on the behalf of a business.
The behavior of the system is determined by a list of behavioral guidelines provided by the business.
Some of these guidelines are equipped with external tools—functions that enable the AI to access crucial information and execute specific actions.
Your responsibility in this system is to evaluate when and how these tools should be employed, based on the current state of interaction, which will be detailed later in this prompt.

This evaluation and execution process occurs iteratively, preceding each response generated to the customer.
Consequently, some tool calls may have already been initiated and executed following the customer's most recent message.
Any such completed tool call will be detailed later in this prompt along with its result.
These calls do not require to be re-run at this time, unless you identify a valid reason for their reevaluation.

Guidelines:
- Only call the tool if it's clearly relevant to the customer's current request
- Extract parameter values directly from the conversation or context variables
- If a required parameter value cannot be determined, do not call the tool
- Do not call the tool if the same call is already staged



The following is a list of events describing a back-and-forth
interaction between you and a user: ###
['{"event_kind": "message", "event_source": "user", "data": {"participant": "test_customer", "message": "Hi I see that my credit limit is low. Can I change it?"}}', '{"event_kind": "message", "event_source": "ai_agent", "data": {"participant": "test-agent", "message": "Sure, I can help with that. Can you please provide your account name?"}}', '{"event_kind": "message", "event_source": "user", "data": {"participant": "test_customer", "message": "Yes, it\'s Alice"}}', '{"event_kind": "message", "event_source": "ai_agent", "data": {"participant": "test-agent", "message": "Thanks, Alice. What would you like your new credit limit to be?"}}', '{"event_kind": "message", "event_source": "user", "data": {"participant": "test_customer", "message": "$20,000"}}', '{"event_kind": "message", "event_source": "ai_agent", "data": {"participant": "test-agent", "message": "Got it. You\'d like to change your credit limit to $20,000. Please confirm the request so I can proceed."}}', '{"event_kind": "message", "event_source": "user", "data": {"participant": "test_customer", "message": "Yes that\'s good thanks"}}']

TOOL TO EVALUATE:
-----------------
Name: local:get_credit_limit
Description: Retrieves the current credit limit for a given account.
Parameters: {
  "username": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "The account's username"
  }
}
Required parameters: ['username']



EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - Tool should be called:
Conversation: "What's the weather in Paris?"
Tool: get_weather(city: str)
Output: {"name": "service:get_weather", "tool_calls": [{"should_call": true, "same_call_is_already_staged": false, "parameters": [{"parameter_name": "city", "value_as_string": "Paris"}]}]}

Example 2 - Tool should not be called:
Conversation: "Hello, how are you?"
Tool: get_weather(city: str)
Output: {"name": "service:get_weather", "tool_calls": [{"should_call": false, "same_call_is_already_staged": false, "parameters": null}]}

Example 3 - Multiple calls needed:
Conversation: "Compare weather in Paris and London"
Tool: get_weather(city: str)
Output: {"name": "service:get_weather", "tool_calls": [{"should_call": true, "same_call_is_already_staged": false, "parameters": [{"parameter_name": "city", "value_as_string": "Paris"}]}, {"should_call": true, "same_call_is_already_staged": false, "parameters": [{"parameter_name": "city", "value_as_string": "London"}]}]}
