## 📌 What is it?

`fsync-conscious` is a **conscious directory diff, audit, and sync tool**.

It exists because **copying and pasting folders is a blind operation**.

This project is built on a simple principle:

> **Never sync what you don’t understand.**

Before applying any change, fsync:
- computes explicit diffs
- classifies risks
- detects real filesystem errors
- generates auditable reports
- fails honestly when needed

---

## 🎯 Problem it solves

Common tools (`cp`, GUIs, copy/paste):

- silently overwrite files
- don’t explain what changed
- don’t detect unreadable files
- break on sockets, permissions, and mounts
- are not auditable

`fsync-conscious` treats the **filesystem as state**, not just a pile of files.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

- Explicit diff before sync  
- Clear policy > implicit behavior  
- Failures are classified, not hidden  
- Dry-run must produce the **SAME report** as a real sync  
- Hashing is optional, not dogma  
- Nothing is renamed or “fixed” automatically  

---

## 📦 Installation

### From PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install fsync-conscious
````

This installs the `fsync` CLI globally.

---

### Development / editable install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/fsync-conscious.git
cd fsync-conscious
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🚀 Basic usage

All commands follow this pattern:

```bash
fsync <mode> <A> <B> [options]
```

Where:

* **A** → source directory (source of truth)
* **B** → destination directory (backup / mirror)

---

## 🔧 Operation modes

### 1️⃣ `diff` — Difference exploration

Shows **what is different** between A and B.
Does not create, copy, or delete anything.

```bash
fsync diff A B
```

Detects:

* missing directories
* new files
* modified files
* extra files in the destination

---

### 2️⃣ `sync` — Conscious synchronization

Updates **B based on A**.

```bash
fsync sync A B
```

By default:

* nothing is deleted
* only new or updated files are copied
* invalid entities are ignored
* execution continues even if some errors occur

---

### 3️⃣ `check` — Equality validation

Verifies whether A and B are equivalent.

```bash
fsync check A B
```

* exit code `0` → identical
* exit code `1` → differences found

Ideal for CI, sanity checks, and automated audits.

---

## 🔍 Comparison strategies

### 📅 Default: `mtime`

By default, comparison is based on:

* file existence
* modification timestamp (`mtime`)

```bash
fsync sync A B
```

#### Advantages

* fast
* low I/O
* no need for file read permissions
* robust for **99% of real-world cases**

---

### 🔐 `--hash` (SHA256)

Enables content-based comparison.

```bash
fsync diff A B --hash
```

Behavior:

* reads full file contents
* detects any real content change
* unreadable files are marked as `UNREADABLE`

⚠️ **Hashing is opt-in by design.**

---

## 🧪 Safety modes

### `--dry-run`

Simulates the entire operation **without writing anything**.

```bash
fsync sync A B --dry-run
```

**Important:**

* the generated report is **IDENTICAL** to a real sync
* only side effects are suppressed

---

### `--strict-fs`

Any error becomes a **fatal error**.

```bash
fsync sync A B --strict-fs
```

Aborts on:

* unreadable files
* invalid filenames for the target filesystem
* write errors
* mount incompatibilities

Ideal for **CI** and **critical backups**.

---

## 🧾 Audit mode

### `--audit-only`

Generates a final report + explicit exit code.

```bash
fsync sync A B --dry-run --audit-only
```

Example output:

```
AUDIT REPORT
copied: 214
skipped: 0
unreadable: 2
invalid: 1
```

---

## 📊 Event classification

fsync classifies everything into four categories:

| Category     | Meaning                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `copied`     | files copied (or that would be copied in dry-run) |
| `skipped`    | ignored by policy                                 |
| `unreadable` | could not be read                                 |
| `invalid`    | invalid name/path for the destination filesystem  |

👉 **Nothing is silent.**

---

## 🚦 Exit codes

Inspired by `rsync`:

| Code | Meaning                     |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| `0`  | total success               |
| `1`  | differences found           |
| `2`  | sync applied                |
| `10` | skipped files               |
| `20` | unreadable files            |
| `30` | invalid files               |
| `99` | fatal error (`--strict-fs`) |

---

## 🧹 Full mirroring

```bash
fsync sync A B --delete
```

Removes from the destination everything that no longer exists in the source.

⚠️ **Use with caution.**

---

## 🔄 Reverse direction

```bash
fsync diff A B --reverse
```

Equivalent to:

```
B → A
```

---

## 🚫 What fsync ignores by design

* sockets (`mysql.sock`)
* FIFOs
* device files
* broken symlinks
* files removed during scan

Filesystems are heterogeneous.
The tool explicitly assumes this.

---

## 🧠 Real-world use cases

* conscious incremental backups
* backup validation
* laptop ↔ external drive
* staging ↔ production
* data audits
* CI/CD pipelines
* Docker environments
* mounted volumes
* critical data sets

---

## ❌ When NOT to use

* one-off disposable copies
* trivial tasks
* non-technical users
* when convenience > control

---

## 🧠 Final insight

> Copy & paste solves an action.
> **fsync solves a process.**

This tool exists for people who need to:

* understand what is happening
* take responsibility
* audit decisions
* avoid silent data loss
