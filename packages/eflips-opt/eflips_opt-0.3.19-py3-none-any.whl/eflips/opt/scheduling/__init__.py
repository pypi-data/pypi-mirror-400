"""

Understand the electric vehicle scneduling problem as a Minimum Path Cover problem. This way, we will find *a* schedule
that has the minimum number of rotations, and from that hopefully derive a good schedule, that is SoC-Aware.

Electrified stations are taking into account in that a trip leading to an electrified station will not consume any
energy. This is a simplification, as we do not take into account that the vehicle may recharge multiple trips' worth of
energy at the station.

    The vehicle scheduling problem needs to be formulated as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the following properties:

    - Nodes are trips. Each trip must have an integer ID. Each trip may have a Tuple of up to eight weights. The weights indicate various cost properties of
    the trip and range from 0 to 1 (float). One example would be to have each first weight of the tuple represent the energy
    consumption of the trip, as fraction of the battery capacity. The second weight could represent the time of the trip as
    a fraction of 24 hours. The solver can then create schedules that exceed neither the battery capacity nor the time.
    - Edges are connections between trips. Each edge has a single weight that represents the cost of the connection. This
    should normally be the waiting time between the trips. However, things such as "try to connect on the same line" can
    also be expressed by scaling the weights. The allowed weights are between 0 and 1e6 (integer).
