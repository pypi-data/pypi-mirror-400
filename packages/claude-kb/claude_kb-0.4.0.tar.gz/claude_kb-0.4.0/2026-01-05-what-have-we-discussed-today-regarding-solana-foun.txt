⏺ Based on the kb search, here's what we discussed today regarding Solana Foundation communications in the sati project:

  Summary of Today's Discussion (Jan 5, 2026)

  Context:
  - You launched SATI to mainnet and posted an announcement from @cascade_fyi
  - You wanted to quote-post from your personal @opwizardx account, thanking Jacob Creech and Jonas from Solana Foundation for their peer review

  Key Decision Point:
  You were uncertain whether to publicly tag @jacobvcreech (Head of DevRel) and @SolPlay_jonas (SF DevRel) in a thank-you post, given:
  - They hadn't replied to your recent Telegram updates
  - No explicit public acknowledgment from them yet
  - Concern about "putting words in their mouth" or implying endorsement

  Founder Skill Guidance:
  The recommendation was to DM Jonas first before posting publicly. A draft was prepared:
  "Hey Jonas—posting a personal reflection on the 2-month SATI journey from my @opwizardx account. Planning to thank LightProtocol and wanted to also acknowledge you and Jacob's peer review feedback. Would you be comfortable being tagged, or prefer I keep it general (e.g., 'Solana DevRel team')? Totally understand either way."

  Outcome:
  Jonas responded within ~9 minutes: "Whatever you like better 😄" — interpreted as a clear green light. You got explicit permission to tag both.

  Post Refinement:
  We then worked on refining the quote post. You chose Option B (more personal/vulnerable):
  2 months from idea to something I'm actually proud of.

  Storing every feedback on-chain without making users pay gas seemed impossible. Solana's architecture + @LightProtocol made it real.

  @SolPlay_jonas and @jacobvcreech challenged the design hard during peer review. The protocol is significantly better because of it.

  Now the real work begins—getting agents to use it.

  Later in the conversation, we also discussed your pattern of overthinking posts and the tension between perfectionism vs. consistent building in public.
