        all other attempts across the entire system to acquire the same path **via OTHER instances** will block until
        the locked instance's `cryolock.Lock.release` is called. `cryolock.Lock`s are guaranteed to be atomic.

        Instances of `cryolock.Lock` are NOT thread-safe and only provide file-based lock mechanisms; see
        `cryolock.Lock.acquire` and `cryolock.Lock.release` for details. It is best practice to use `cryolock.Lock`
        instances in conjunction with `threading.Lock` if thread-safety or traditional lock functionality is required.

        - `path` must be a valid path formatted as a string which ends with ".cryolock". It is crucial for the path to
          either not lead to a file, to lead to a directory that contains no non-lock files, or to lead to nothing.
        - `capacity` can be a `float` that specifies after how many seconds of inactivity the lock can be considered
          dead by other `cryolock.Lock` instances across the system. This is useful for avoiding deadlocks in the case
          of system failure. Acquired instances attempt to constantly keep their lock active; trying to never take more
          than `capacity / 2` seconds between attempts. Theoretically it is possible for a `cryolock.Lock` to fail if
          the capacity is set low enough and the hardware is weak enough, so the option to completely prevent a lock
          from ever being considered dead is given and can be used by setting `capacity` to `None`.

        `cryolock.Lock` supports the context manager protocol and thus may be used in `with` statements.
