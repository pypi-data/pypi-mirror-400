# Conventional Commits

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages.

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message must follow this structure:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Types

- **feat**: A new feature for the user
- **fix**: A bug fix for the user
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

## Scope

The scope is optional and should be a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parentheses. Examples:

- `feat(clients)`: Add Redis client connection pooling
- `fix(workflow)`: Resolve metadata extraction timeout issue
- `docs(readme)`: Update installation instructions

## Description

- Use the imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" nor "adds"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period (.) at the end
- Keep it concise (50 characters or less is ideal)

## Body

The body is optional and should provide additional context about the change:

- Use the imperative, present tense
- Explain the motivation for the change
- Contrast with previous behavior
- Wrap at 72 characters

## Footer

The footer is optional and is used for:

- **Breaking Changes**: Must begin with `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by a description
- **Issue References**: Reference GitHub issues, e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`

## Examples

### Simple commit

```
feat: add user authentication
```

### Commit with scope

```
fix(sql): resolve connection pool exhaustion
```

### Commit with body

```
feat(observability): add distributed tracing support

Implement OpenTelemetry integration for end-to-end request tracing.
This enables better debugging and performance analysis across services.
```

### Breaking change

```
feat(clients)!: change authentication method

BREAKING CHANGE: The client authentication now requires OAuth2 tokens
instead of API keys. Update your configuration to use the new auth flow.

Closes #789
```

### Revert commit

```
revert: feat(workflow): add automatic retry logic

This reverts commit abc123def456.
```

## Guidelines

- **Be atomic**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
- **Be descriptive**: The description should clearly explain what changed and why
- **Be consistent**: Follow the same patterns across all commits
- **Reference issues**: Link commits to relevant GitHub issues when applicable
- **Test before committing**: Ensure all tests pass before creating a commit
- **Review the diff**: Always review your changes before committing

## Tools

Consider using tools to help enforce conventional commits:

- [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) - Interactive commit message wizard
- [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) - Lint commit messages
- Git hooks to validate commit messages before accepting them
