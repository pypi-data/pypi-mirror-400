Help Menu:
    This module is for uploading grades and student files to quercus.

    You will need at least:
        - A csv file with an "id" column. These ids should be UTORID
        - The course id
        - The assignment id

    Ids can be found by going on the course website, navigating to the assignment, and looking at the URL:
        https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/[COURSE ID]/assignments/[ASSIGNMENT ID]

    FILE UPLOADING
    Files need to contain UTORIDs in the file names in order to match them to the correct student

    GRADE UPLOADING
    Your .csv file will need to have a "grade" column as well as an "id" column.

    For best results, make sure your csv is clean (no columns with blank headers, no duplicate columns no cells with just spaces, etc.)
