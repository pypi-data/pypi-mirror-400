        "text": "Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is a 3′-exoribonuclease that removes poly(A) tails from the 3′ end of RNAs. PARN is known to deadenylate some ncRNAs, including hTR, Y RNAs, and some miRNAs and thereby enhance their stability by limiting the access of 3′ to 5′ exonucleases recruited by oligo(A) tails. Several PARN-regulated miRNAs target p53 mRNA, and PARN knockdown leads to an increase of p53 protein levels in human cells. Thus, PARN inhibitors might be used to induce p53 levels in some human tumors and act as a therapeutic strategy to treat cancers caused by repressed p53 protein. Herein, we used computational-based molecular docking and high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify small molecule inhibitors of PARN. Validation with in vitro and cell-based assays, identified 4 compounds, including 3 novel compounds and pyrimidopyrimidin-2-one GNF-7, previously shown to be a Bcr-Abl inhibitor, as PARN inhibitors. These inhibitors can be used as tool compounds and as lead compounds for the development of improved PARN inhibitors.",

In this pathway, Y RNAs, snoRNAs, the human telomerase RNA (hTR), and some miRNAs can be oligoadenylated by noncanonical poly(A) polymerases, such as paralogs PAPD5 and PAPD7 [8][9][10][11][12] . The presence of the oligo(A) tail can then recruit processive sequence-independent 3′ to 5′ exonucleases to degrade ncRNAs 9,11,[13][14][15][16][17] . Alternatively, the oligoadenylated tail can be removed by adenosine specific 3′ to 5′ exonucleases such as PARN to maintain stability of ncRNAs. Thus, when PARN is inhibited or defective, some ncRNAs are prematurely degraded, including hTR [9][10][11][12][17][18][19][20] .",

This assay was modeled on a similar assay developed for Caf1/CNOT7 deadenylase 37 . In this assay, PARN 1-430 was incubated with a 5′-fluorescently labeled oligoadenylated RNA. In the absence of deadenylation, this substrate RNA can effectively hybridize to a complementary DNA oligonucleotide with a quencher on its 3′ end leading to a loss of fluorescence (Fig. 3a). When the RNA substrate is deadenylated, the quenching oligonucleotide is no longer able to stably hybridize leading to an increase in fluorescence in the reaction.",

Finally, we observed that fluorescence correlates with shortening of the 3′ oligo A tail on the substrate by running the material on a gel and observing shortening of the substrate with PARN 1-430 , but no shortening with PARNmut (Figs. 2c and 3d).

This library was utilized as the kinase inhibitors are ATP-mimetics and the PARN active site binds adenosine. The PARN nuclease domain includes the four conserved residues among DEDD superfamily, Asp28, Glu30, Asp292, and Asp382, that are important for the catalytic activity of PARN and are required for the binding of divalent metal ions 38 . Mutations of these residues lead to loss of function in PARN [38][39][40] . Therefore, based on this information, we targeted this catalytic site of PARN and selected highranking compounds by XP GScore, an approximation of ligand binding free energy, and by interaction with the Asp28-Phe31 region. Analysis of the docking simulation identified several structurally distinct compounds predicted to dock into the PARN catalytic pocket (Fig. 4).",

Of the compounds from the HTS, TH11, 15, and 16 showed the strongest effects and reduced miR-21-5p levels to ~ 50% compared to the controls (Fig. 7f and g). These effects were similar to a PARN KD, which reduced miR-21-5p levels to ~ 75% compared with siRNA controls. None of the compounds reduced PARN protein levels in Hela cells (Fig. 7a and b). Moreover, RT-qPCR was done to examine the changes in hTR levels of the compounds, which confirmed a decrease in levels of hTR with compounds or siPARN treatments, compared to the controls, (Fig. 7e and h). This suggested that GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 treatments can inhibit PARN activity in cells and thereby decrease specific RNA levels. Previous work has shown that PARN inhibition leads to cell death in combination with DNA damaging agent, which has been interpreted to occur through the induction of p53 11 . Given this, we examined if GNF-7, TH11, TH15, or TH16 affected cell growth either by themselves or in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin. We observed that at 25 μM GNF-7 and 10 μM of TH11, TH15, and TH16, Hela cells showed growth defects compared to DMSO treatment (Fig. 8a and c). More importantly, we observed that both PARN KD (as previously shown) and cells treated with these compounds showed increased cell death after 24 h of doxorubicin treatment compared to the scramble siRNA and DMSO controls (Fig. 8b and d). This indicates that GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 increase the sensitivity of cells to the chemotherapeutic agent, possibly through upregulating p53.",

Thus, targeting PARN may offer a potential therapeutic approach for repressed p53-induced cancers. Previous reports have described aminoglycosides, synthetic nucleotides with fluoro-glucopyranosyl sugar moiety and benzoyl-modified cytosine or adenine, glucopyranosyl analogs bearing uracil, 5-fluorouracil, or thymine as base moiety, and purine-2,6-dione derivatives as possible PARN inhibitors (Table 1), although these compounds required relatively high concentrations and/or have not been shown to inhibit PARN activity in cells 30,[32][33][34] . While some purine-2,6-dione derivatives showed PARN inhibition at relatively low concentrations: 30 μM (5b, 8a-d, and 8f), 10 μM (5j and 5k), and 3 μM (8e and 8j) using a similar fluorescence assay, only five IC50 values were reported with the lowest value of 23.9 ± 3.7 μM (compound 8j) (Table 1) 34 .

      "text": "Several observations argue GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 can inhibit PARN in cells. First, these drug treatments of cells decreased the levels of hTR and miR-21-5p (Fig. 7c-h), as is seen in PARN-deficient cells 9,11,12,17,18 . Second, we observed that GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 acted similarly to siRNA KD of PARN at increasing cell death in the presence of doxorubicin (Fig. 8b and d). Taken together, we propose that GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 can be used as chemical tools for the inhibition of PARN both in vitro and in cells. However, since these compounds can inhibit a range of kinases, finding additional PARN inhibitors, or developing derivatives of these compounds with more selectivity for PARN is an important future area of future research.",

Prior to docking, the water molecules were removed, and the proteins were prepared by assigning bond orders, adding hydrogens, and repairing any side chains or missing amino acid sequences. To complete protein preparation a restrained minimization of the protein structure was performed using the default constraint of 0.30 Å RMSD and the OPLS_2005 force field 47 . The prepared protein was subjected to SiteMap analysis 46 , that identified the catalytic binding site and docking grids were generated using Receptor Grid Generation. The compounds in the SelleckChem kinase inhibitor library were prepared using LigPrep by generating possible states at the target pH 7.0 using Epik and minimized by applying the OPLS_2005 force field 47 . Molecular docking simulations were performed using the Glide ligand docking module in XP (extra precision) mode and included post-docking minimization 45 . The docked structures were examined and high-ranked compounds with favorable XP GScores for ligand binding, that displayed interaction with residues Asp28-Phe31, the divalent metal cation binding site within the active site (Fig. 4), were selected for evaluation. The XP GScore is an empirical scoring function that approximates the ligand binding free energy; therefore, a more negative value represents favorable binding.",

The assay is based on a 5′ FAM-labelled RNA oligonucleotide substrate. After incubation of the substrate in the presence of PARN 1-430 , the reaction is stopped and a 3′ BHQ-labelled DNA oligonucleotide probe complementary to the RNA substrate is added. The fluorescence of intact substrate is quenched upon probe hybridization because of the proximity of the BHQ fluorophore. In contrast, the BHQ-labelled probe cannot hybridize to the FAM-labelled reaction product allowing detection of FAM fluorescence 37 .
