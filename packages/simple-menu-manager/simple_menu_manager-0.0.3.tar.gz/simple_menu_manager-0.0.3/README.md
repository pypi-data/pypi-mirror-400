# Python Simple Menu Manager V. 0.0.3


## Purpose

This project was created so that I could have a relieable, simple, lightweight menu manager for use in CLI based tools.


## Installation 

To install simply run  
`pip install simple_menu_manager`


## Usage

This package allows for a reactive menu management experience without multiple added packages (apart from this of course).

The menu manager will always return the associated number based on the options submitted, starting at "1" for the first option.  
The exit/return condition will always return "0".

#### Usage Example
```python
from simple_menu_manager import simple_menu


simple_menu.menu_handler(
    message="Choose an option:",
    options=[
        "Option 1",
        "Option 2",
        "Option 3",
        "Option 4",
        "Option 5",
        "Option 6",
        "Option 7",
        "Option 8",
        "Option 9",
        "Option 10"
    ],
    return_message="Exit",
    menu_type="default",
    verbose=False) 
```
