class BatchMixin:
    """
    Mixin base class for :term:`data models <data model>` which
    represent a :term:`batch`.

    See also :class:`BatchRowMixin` which should be used for the row
    model.

    For a batch model (table) to be useful, at least one :term:`batch
    handler` must be defined, which is able to process data for that
    :term:`batch type`.

    .. attribute:: batch_type

       This is the canonical :term:`batch type` for the batch model.

       By default this will match the underlying table name for the
       batch, but the model class can set it explicitly to override.

    .. attribute:: __row_class__

       Reference to the specific :term:`data model` class used for the
       :term:`batch rows <batch row>`.

       This will be a subclass of :class:`BatchRowMixin` (among other
       classes).

       When defining the batch model, you do not have to set this as
       it will be assigned automatically based on
       :attr:`BatchRowMixin.__batch_class__`.

    .. attribute:: id

       Numeric ID for the batch, unique across all batches (regardless
       of type).

       See also :attr:`id_str`.

    .. attribute:: description

       Simple description for the batch.

    .. attribute:: notes

       Arbitrary notes for the batch.

    .. attribute:: rows

       List of data rows for the batch, aka. :term:`batch rows <batch
       row>`.

       Each will be an instance of :class:`BatchRowMixin` (among other
       base classes).

    .. attribute:: row_count

       Cached row count for the batch, i.e. how many :attr:`rows` it has.

       No guarantees perhaps, but this should ideally be accurate (it
       ultimately depends on the :term:`batch handler`
       implementation).

    .. attribute:: STATUS

       Dict of possible batch status codes and their human-readable
       names.

       Each key will be a possible :attr:`status_code` and the
       corresponding value will be the human-readable name.

       See also :attr:`status_text` for when more detail/subtlety is
       needed.

       Typically each "key" (code) is also defined as its own
       "constant" on the model class.  For instance::

          from collections import OrderedDict
          from wuttjamaican.db import model

          class MyBatch(model.BatchMixin, model.Base):
              \""" my custom batch \"""

              STATUS_INCOMPLETE = 1
              STATUS_EXECUTABLE = 2

              STATUS = OrderedDict([
                  (STATUS_INCOMPLETE, "incomplete"),
                  (STATUS_EXECUTABLE, "executable"),
              ])

              # TODO: column definitions...

       And in fact, the above status definition is the built-in
       default.  However it is expected for subclass to overwrite the
       definition entirely (in similar fashion to above) when needed.

       .. note::
          There is not any built-in logic around these integer codes;
          subclass can use any the developer prefers.

          Of course, once you define one, if any live batches use it,
          you should not then change its fundamental meaning (although
          you can change the human-readable text).

          It's recommended to use
          :class:`~python:collections.OrderedDict` (as shown above) to
          ensure the possible status codes are displayed in the
          correct order, when applicable.

    .. attribute:: status_code

       Status code for the batch as a whole.  This indicates whether
       the batch is "okay" and ready to execute, or (why) not etc.

       This must correspond to an existing key within the
       :attr:`STATUS` dict.

       See also :attr:`status_text`.

    .. attribute:: status_text

       Text which may (briefly) further explain the batch
       :attr:`status_code`, if needed.

       For example, assuming built-in default :attr:`STATUS`
       definition::

          batch.status_code = batch.STATUS_INCOMPLETE
          batch.status_text = "cannot execute batch because it is missing something"

    .. attribute:: created

       When the batch was first created.

    .. attribute:: created_by

       Reference to the :class:`~wuttjamaican.db.model.auth.User` who
       first created the batch.

    .. attribute:: executed

       When the batch was executed.

    .. attribute:: executed_by

       Reference to the :class:`~wuttjamaican.db.model.auth.User` who
       executed the batch.
