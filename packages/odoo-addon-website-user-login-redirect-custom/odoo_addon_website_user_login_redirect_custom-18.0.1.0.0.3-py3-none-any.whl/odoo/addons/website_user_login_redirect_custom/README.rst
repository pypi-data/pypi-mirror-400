This module allows administrators to configure a custom URL where
website users will be redirected after login or registration. The same
applies to new signups.

Use Cases / Context
===================

By default, when a website/portal user logs into Odoo, they are
redirected to their portal page. In some cases, this may disrupt the
desired flow (for example, you want users to go directly to /shop or
/thank-you pages). This module allows specifying a custom redirect URL
after login or signup.

Configuration
=============

- Go to Website → Configuration → Settings
- Scroll to the Privacy section
- Enable the checkbox “Redirect on Login/Signup”
- Enter your relative URL (e.g., /, /shop, /thank-you-for-joining-us)

Usage
=====

Log in or sign up as a website user.

If redirect is enabled, you will be automatically redirected to the
specified custom URL.
