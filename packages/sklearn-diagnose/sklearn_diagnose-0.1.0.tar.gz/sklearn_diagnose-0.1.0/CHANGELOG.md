## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-02

### Added

- Initial release of sklearn-diagnose
- Core `diagnose()` function for model failure diagnosis
- LLM-driven architecture:
  - Signal extractors for deterministic statistics
  - LLM-powered hypothesis generation (failure mode detection with confidence/severity)
  - LLM-powered recommendation generation
  - LLM-powered summary generation
- Detection of 7 failure modes:
  - Overfitting
  - Underfitting
  - High variance
  - Label noise
  - Feature redundancy
  - Class imbalance
  - Data leakage (suspicious patterns)
- Support for any fitted scikit-learn estimator or Pipeline
- Support for both holdout validation and cross-validation results
- Actionable recommendations generated by LLM
- LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic) for all generation tasks
- Read-only guarantee (never modifies estimator or data)
- Comprehensive test suite (23 tests)

### Security

- Data leakage detection between train/validation sets
- Input validation and fail-fast for unfitted models
