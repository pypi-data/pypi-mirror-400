Guidelines:
- use pydantic BaseModel over dataclasses
- prefer 'import typing as T' over 'import typing'
- prefer 'from pathlib import Path' over 'import os'
- don't block the asyncio event loop with sync code
- be concise in comments
- in each module, prefer the most central function/class up top and helpers below
- for multi-line functions, keep each argument on a new line with a trailing comma
- use typer for CLI scripts

Function format example:
```
async def my_function(
    arg1: int,
    arg2: str,
    arg3: bool = False,
) -> None:
    """
    My function one-liner
    """
    pass
```

Linting:
`ruff check .`
`ruff format .`
`mypy .`
