description: "Implement a feature in an isolated git worktree"
---

# Goal

**Implement the assigned feature completely.** Do NOT wait for confirmation or permission.

You are working in an isolated git worktree - a safe sandbox where you can make bold changes without affecting the main project.

## Your Mission

The feature details are provided in the **🎯 Worktree Context** section at the end of this prompt. Your job is to:

1. Complete a quick environment check (30 seconds max)
2. Implement ALL acceptance criteria for the feature
3. Test your implementation
4. Commit with a descriptive message

**Do not stop after the environment check. Proceed immediately to implementation.**

---

## Quick Environment Check (Do This First)

```bash
# Verify you're in the worktree
pwd
git branch --show-current

# Check project status (brief)
klondike status
```

> ⚡ Spend no more than 30 seconds on orientation. Then start coding.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Work Freely

🔒 **Isolation**: You're on a dedicated branch in a separate directory  
✅ **Safe commits**: Nothing affects main until explicitly merged  

- **Commit often** - Even incomplete work. It's YOUR branch.
- **Experiment** - Try risky refactors. The main project is safe.
- **Break things** - If it goes wrong, the worktree can be deleted.

### Commit Workflow

```bash
# Work-in-progress commits are fine
git add -A && git commit -m "wip: <description>"

# Final commit should be descriptive
git add -A && git commit -m "feat(F00X): <summary>

- Implemented <details>
- Added tests for <coverage>
- Meets all acceptance criteria"
```

### Before You Finish

1. **All acceptance criteria are met**
2. **Code compiles/lints** - Run the project's lint/build commands
3. **Tests pass** - if applicable
4. **Final commit** with descriptive message

---

## Session Rules

❌ **Do NOT** push to remote without explicit permission  
❌ **Do NOT** modify the main project directory directly  
❌ **Do NOT** wait for human confirmation - you are in non-interactive mode

---

## CRITICAL: Do Not Wait

**You are in non-interactive mode.** There is no human to confirm anything.

After the quick environment check, proceed IMMEDIATELY to implementing the feature described in the Worktree Context below. Do not ask for permission. Do not wait. Just implement.
