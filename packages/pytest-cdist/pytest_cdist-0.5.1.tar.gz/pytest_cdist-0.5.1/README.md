# pytest-cdist

Like pytest-xdist, but for distributed environments - pytest-cdist allows to split a 
test suite into multiple parts and run them independently.

**This is a work in progress**

## Why?

pytest-xdist can help to parallelize test execution, as long as you can scale
horizontally. In many environments, such as GitHub actions with GitHub runners, this is
only possible to a fairly limited degree, which can be an issue if your test suite grows
large. pytest-cdist can help with this by allowing to execute individual chunks of your
test suite in a deterministic order, so you can use multiple concurrent jobs to run each
individual chunk.


## How?

```bash
pytest --cdist-group=1/2  # will run the first half of the test suite
pytest --cdist-group=2/2  # will run the second half of the test suite
```

*In a GitHub workflow*

```yaml

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    matrix:
      strategy:
        cdist-groups: [1, 2, 3, 4]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # set up environment here
      - name: Run pytest
        run: pytest --cdist-group=${{ matrix.cdist-group }}/4
```

## Usage

### Configuration

Pytest-cdist comes with several CLI and pytest-ini options:

| CLI                     | Ini                   | Allowed values                                                               | Default |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `--cdist-justify-items` | `cdist-justify-items` | `none`, `file`, `scope`                                                      | `none`  |
| `--cdist-group-steal`   | `--cdist-group-steal` | `<target group>:<percentage>` / `<target group>:<percentage>:<source group>` | -       |
| `--cdist-report`        | -                     | -                                                                            | false   |
| `--cdist-report-dir`    | `cdist-report-dir`    |                                                                              | `.`     |


### Controlling how items are split up

By default, pytest-cdist will split up the items into groups as evenly as possible.
Sometimes this may not be desired, for example if there's some costly fixtures requested
by multiple tests, which should ideally only run once. 

To solve this, the `cdist-justify-items` option can be used to configure how items are
split up. It can take two possible values: 

- `file`: Ensure all items inside a file end up in the same group
- `scope`: Ensure all items in the same pytest scope end up in the same group

```ini
[pytest]
cdist-justify-items=file
```

```bash
pytest --cdist-group=1/2 --cdist-justify-items=file
```


### Skewing the group sizes

Normally, items are distributed evenly among groups, which is a good default, but there
may be cases where this will result in an uneven execution time, if one group contains
a number of slower tests than the other ones. 

To work around this, the `cdist-group-steal` option can be used. It allows to specific 
a certain percentage of items a group will "steal" from other groups. For example 
`--cdist-group-steal=2:30` will cause group `2` to steal 30% of items from all other 
groups.

```ini
[pytest]
cdist-group-steal=2:30
```

```bash
pytest --cdist-group=1/2 --cdist-group-steal=2:30
```

It is also possible to redistribute items between two specific groups, by specifying 
both as source and a target group. The following configuration would assign 50% of the 
items in group 1 to group 2:

```bash
pytest --cdist-group=1/3 --cdist-group-steal=1:50:2
```


### With pytest-xdist

When running under pytest-xdist, pytest-cdist will honour tests marked with 
`xdist_group`, and group them together in the same cdist group. 


### With pytest-randomly

To use pytest-cdist with 
[pytest-randomly](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-randomly)'s test reordering, a 
randomness seed that's consistent across the different pytest 
invocations needs to be specified, otherwise, test cases would be dropped, since 
pytest-cdist has to rely on a consistent collection order to split test cases among its
groups.

To achieve this, a random source such as the current timestamp can be used:

```yaml
jobs:
  setup_randomly_seed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      randomly_seed: ${{ steps.set-seed.outputs.randomly_seed }}
    steps:
      - name: Set seed
        id: set-seed
        run: echo "randomly_seed=$(date +%s)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: setup_randomly_seed
    matrix:
      strategy:
        cdist-groups: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run pytest
        run: > 
          pytest 
          --cdist-group=${{ matrix.cdist-group }}/4 
          --randomly-seed=${{ needs.setup_randomly_seeds.outputs.randomly_seed }}
```

or a bit simpler (but less random), using the current git hash:

```yaml
jobs:        
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: setup_randomly_seed
    matrix:
      strategy:
        cdist-groups: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run pytest
        run: > 
          pytest 
          --cdist-group=${{ matrix.cdist-group }}/4 
          --randomly-seed=$((16#$(git rev-parse HEAD)))
```
