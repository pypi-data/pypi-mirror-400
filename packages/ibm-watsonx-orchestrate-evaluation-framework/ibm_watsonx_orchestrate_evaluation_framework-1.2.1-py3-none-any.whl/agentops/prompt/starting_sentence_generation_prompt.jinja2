## Generation Guidelines

The starting sentence shouldn't be the same as the story. The story is the objective of the conversation, while the starting sentence is the initial question a user would ask in order to achieve that objective.
The generated starting sentence should be a concise, no longer than one sentence, and in first person.

## Output:
Respond in a JSON format with the following fields:
- starting_sentence: this is the generated starting sentence 

This is an example of a valid JSON output
