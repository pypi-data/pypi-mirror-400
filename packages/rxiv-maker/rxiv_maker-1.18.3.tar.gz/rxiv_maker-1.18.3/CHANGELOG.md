## [v1.12.1] - 2025-11-20

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removed "inline" method placement option based on user testing feedback
  - **New numeric mapping**: Now 1-4 (was 1-5 in v1.12.0)
    - `1` → `"after_intro"` (Methods after Introduction, classic paper style)
    - `2` → `"after_results"` (Methods after Results, before Discussion)
    - `3` → `"after_discussion"` (Methods after Discussion, before Bibliography)
    - `4` → `"after_bibliography"` (Methods after Bibliography - Nature Methods style - **DEFAULT**)
  - **Removed option**: `"inline"` (true inline placement) - not working reliably based on testing
  - **Numeric values shifted**: Users with numeric values 2-5 in v1.12.0 need to update to 1-4 in v1.12.1
  - **String values unchanged**: `"after_intro"`, `"after_results"`, `"after_discussion"`, `"after_bibliography"` still work

### Removed
- **"inline" placement option**: Complete removal of inline mode due to reliability issues
  - Removed from numeric mapping (was option 1 in v1.12.0)
  - Removed from validation schema enum
  - Removed from template documentation
  - Removed inline-specific logic block in template processor
  - Removed test_methods_placement_inline unit test

### Migration Guide from v1.12.0
Update your `00_CONFIG.yml` if using `methods_placement`:

**If you used numeric values in v1.12.0:**
- **Was**: `1` (inline) → **Now**: Use `1` (`"after_intro"`) or remove for default behavior
- **Was**: `2` (after_intro) → **Now**: Use `1` (`"after_intro"`)
- **Was**: `3` (after_results) → **Now**: Use `2` (`"after_results"`)
- **Was**: `4` (after_discussion) → **Now**: Use `3` (`"after_discussion"`)
- **Was**: `5` (after_bibliography) → **Now**: Use `4` (`"after_bibliography"`)

**If you used string "inline" in v1.12.0:**
- **Was**: `methods_placement: "inline"`
- **Now**: Use `methods_placement: "after_intro"` or `methods_placement: 1` for similar behavior
- **Note**: True inline behavior (preserving authoring order) is no longer supported

**If you used string values (not "inline"):**
- No changes needed - string values remain the same
- `"after_intro"`, `"after_results"`, `"after_discussion"`, `"after_bibliography"` unchanged

### Technical Details
- Updated numeric mapping: `src/rxiv_maker/processors/template_processor.py:424-429` (1-4 instead of 1-5)
- Updated validation schema: `src/rxiv_maker/config/validator.py:374-387` (enum without "inline", max 4 instead of 5)
- Updated init template: `src/rxiv_maker/templates/registry.py:136-139` (documentation updated)
- Removed inline logic block: `src/rxiv_maker/processors/template_processor.py:464-480` (deleted)
- Removed unit test: `tests/unit/test_template_processor.py:141-174` (test_methods_placement_inline deleted)
- Updated visual tests: `tests/visual/methods-placement/` (README.md, 01_MAIN.md, 00_CONFIG.yml updated)
- All 5 remaining methods placement tests passing (inline test removed)
- Section order preservation code retained but no longer used (future-proofing)

## [v1.12.0] - 2025-11-19

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Method placement feature completely redesigned with 5 options and true inline support
  - **New default**: `"after_bibliography"` (was `"inline"` in v1.11.x)
  - **Numeric mapping updated**: Now 1-5 (was 1-3 in v1.11.2)
    - `1` → `"inline"` (TRUE inline - preserves exact authoring order)
    - `2` → `"after_intro"` (NEW - Methods after Introduction, classic paper style)
    - `3` → `"after_results"` (Methods after Results, before Discussion)
    - `4` → `"after_discussion"` (NEW - Methods after Discussion, before Bibliography)
    - `5` → `"after_bibliography"` (Methods after Bibliography - Nature Methods style - **DEFAULT**)
  - **True inline behavior**: `"inline"` now preserves exact authoring order from markdown
    - Old `"inline"` behavior (after intro + custom sections) is now `"after_intro"`
  - **No backward compatibility**: Old numeric values (1-3) map to different options
  - Fallback changed from `"inline"` to `"after_bibliography"` for invalid values

### Added
- **New placement option**: `"after_intro"` - Places Methods after Introduction section
- **New placement option**: `"after_discussion"` - Places Methods after Discussion, before Bibliography
- **Section order preservation**: Markdown sections now maintain their authoring order for true inline placement
- **New template placeholder**: `<PY-RPL:METHODS-AFTER-DISCUSSION>` for after_discussion mode

### Fixed
- **Inline placement behavior**: `"inline"` now correctly preserves authoring order instead of forcing Methods after Introduction
  - Previously: `"inline"` placed Methods after Introduction + custom sections
  - Now: `"inline"` places Methods exactly where authored in markdown
  - For old behavior, use `"after_intro"`

### Migration Guide
Update your `00_CONFIG.yml` if using `methods_placement`:

**If you used numeric values:**
- **Was**: `1` (inline after intro) → **Now**: Use `2` (`"after_intro"`)
- **Was**: `2` (after_results) → **Now**: Use `3` (`"after_results"`)
- **Was**: `3` (after_bibliography) → **Now**: Use `5` (`"after_bibliography"`)

**If you relied on default behavior:**
- **Was**: Default `"inline"` (Methods after Introduction)
- **Now**: Default `"after_bibliography"` (Methods after Bibliography)
- **Action**: Explicitly set `methods_placement: "after_intro"` or `methods_placement: 2` for old behavior

**If you want TRUE inline behavior:**
- Set `methods_placement: "inline"` or `methods_placement: 1`
- Methods will appear exactly where authored in your markdown

### Technical Details
- Section order tracking: `src/rxiv_maker/converters/section_processor.py` now returns tuple `(sections, section_order)`
- True inline implementation: `src/rxiv_maker/processors/template_processor.py:464-480`

### Fixed
- **Init Template Figure Example**: Template now includes working `.mmd` figure reference out-of-the-box
  - Previously: No figure example (removed due to validation errors)
  - Now: `![](FIGURES/Figure__example.mmd)` with proper pandoc syntax
  - Example Mermaid diagram automatically converts to PDF on first build
  - Provides immediate working example for new users

### Changed
- **Template Structure Improvements**:

  - Original string values still work: `"inline"`, `"after_results"`, `"after_bibliography"`
  - Backward compatible - all existing configs continue to work

### Fixed
- **Validation with Fallback**: Invalid `methods_placement` values now show clear warning and fallback to `"inline"`
  - Prevents Methods section from disappearing with invalid config values
  - Warning message guides users to correct syntax: `⚠️  Warning: Invalid methods_placement value "X". Using "inline" as fallback. Valid options: inline, after_results, after_bibliography or numeric values 1-3`
- **Version Display**: Update checker now shows correct runtime version instead of stale cached version
  - Fixed development mode showing `v1.9.1 → v1.9.4` when actual version is v1.11.2

  - **Old config** (removed): `methods_after_bibliography: true/false`
  - **New config**: `methods_placement: "inline" | "after_results" | "after_bibliography"`
  - **Three placement options**:
    - `"inline"` (default): Methods appears wherever you write it in the manuscript (most flexible)
    - `"after_results"`: Methods appears after Results section, before Discussion
    - `"after_bibliography"`: Methods appears after Bibliography (Nature Methods style)
  - No backward compatibility - old config will be ignored
  - Requested by user for more flexible Methods section positioning

### Migration Guide
Update your `00_CONFIG.yml`:
- **Was**: `methods_after_bibliography: false` → **Now**: `methods_placement: "inline"`
- **Was**: `methods_after_bibliography: true` → **Now**: `methods_placement: "after_bibliography"`
- **New option**: `methods_placement: "after_results"` (Methods after Results, before Discussion)

## [v1.10.0] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed white space issue in two-column layouts with `tex_position="p"` figures
  - **Issue**: Text in second column would cut off early, leaving white space before dedicated page figures
  - **Root cause**: Code was setting `barrier=True` for dedicated page figures, adding `\FloatBarrier` after the figure, which prevented subsequent text from flowing to fill the current page
  - **Solution**: Remove `barrier=True` to allow subsequent text (e.g., Results section) to flow naturally and fill the current page
  - Upgraded position specifier from `[p]` to `[p!]` for stronger LaTeX placement guidance
  - Resolves issue reported by Guillaume Jacquemet
  - Verified with Zebrafish manuscript: Results section text now fills page 1 completely, figure appears on page 2

### Technical Details
- Dedicated page figures use: `\begin{figure*}[p!]...\end{figure*}` (no FloatBarrier after)
- Changed from `[p]` to `[p!]` for stronger placement control
- Removed `barrier = True` line that was preventing text flow
- LaTeX's float algorithm correctly handles dedicated pages without manual barriers or clearpage wrappers

## [v1.9.4] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- Figure positioning: tex_position="p" now uses figure*[p] consistently; removed clearpage wrappers; ensures dedicated pages in two-column layouts without cutting prior text. Updated visual tests and unit tests accordingly.

## [v1.9.3] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed
- **Text Flow with Dedicated Page Figures**: Restored clearpage wrapper logic from August 2024 fixes
  - Added `\vfill\clearpage` wrapper before dedicated page figures to fill current page with text
  - Added `\clearpage` after figures to ensure text resumes properly after figure page
  - Changed positioning from `[p]` to `[p!]` for stronger LaTeX placement control
  - Resolves text flow disruption issue reported by Guillaume after v1.9.2
  - Fixes the "suite of issues" from August: figures now on dedicated pages WITH proper text flow
  - All 35 figure processor tests pass

## [v1.9.2] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed
- **Figure Positioning**: Fixed `tex_position="p"` figures not appearing on dedicated pages
  - Changed default behavior: `tex_position="p"` now uses `figure*[p]` (two-column spanning) instead of `figure[p]`
  - This ensures LaTeX's float placement algorithm can properly place figures on dedicated pages in two-column documents
  - User-specified widths (e.g., `width="0.8"`) are now respected correctly with `figure*[p]`
  - Opt-out available: Use `singlecol_floatpage=True` to force single-column `figure[p]` if needed
  - Resolves issue reported by Guillaume where figures appeared in text flow instead of on dedicated pages
  - All figure processor tests (35/35) and regression tests pass

## [v1.9.1] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed
- **Import Error**: Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` in workflow commands when importing tips module
  - Corrected import path from `from ..utils import` to `from ...utils.tips import` in `workflow_commands.py:242`
  - Resolves error: "No module named 'rxiv_maker.cli.utils'"
  - This hotfix ensures build success tips display correctly

This release addresses user feedback about false positive update notifications when using Homebrew installations. The root cause was that the update checker always queried PyPI, which might show newer versions before the Homebrew formula is updated. By checking `brew outdated` first for Homebrew installations, we ensure accurate update availability information and eliminate confusing notifications.

The new `rxiv upgrade` command provides a seamless upgrade experience by automatically detecting the installation method and running the appropriate upgrade command, eliminating the need for users to remember method-specific commands.

## [v1.5.5] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- **🐛 BibTeX Error Code 1 - Trailing Slash Issue**: Fixed manuscript path handling when paths contain trailing slashes
  - **Root Cause**: When users run `rxiv pdf CCT8_paper/` (with trailing slash), `os.path.basename("CCT8_paper/")` returns empty string, causing filename validation to default to "MANUSCRIPT"
  - **Mismatch Problem**: This created a mismatch where LaTeX expected to compile `CCT8_paper.tex` but only `MANUSCRIPT.tex` was generated, causing "Emergency stop" and subsequent BibTeX error code 1
  - **Comprehensive Fix**: Added path normalization using `rstrip("/")` in both BuildManager constructor and environment variable setting to handle trailing slashes correctly
  - **Regression Testing**: Added comprehensive test suite `test_trailing_slash_regression.py` to prevent future regressions
  - **User Impact**: Users can now run `rxiv pdf manuscript_name/` (with trailing slash) without encountering BibTeX errors
- **GitHub Issues**: Resolves remaining cases of #100 (BibTeX returned error code 1) related to trailing slash paths
## [v1.5.4] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- **🐛 BibTeX Error Code 1**: Fixed invalid LaTeX filename generation that caused "BibTeX returned error code 1" errors
  - **Root Cause**: When `MANUSCRIPT_PATH` environment variable was set to invalid values (empty string, ".", or ".."), the `write_manuscript_output` function would create files with invalid names like `..tex` or `.tex`
  - **LaTeX Compilation Failure**: These invalid filenames caused LaTeX to fail with "Emergency stop" errors, which subsequently caused BibTeX to fail with error code 1
  - **Robust Validation**: Added input validation to `write_manuscript_output` function to prevent invalid filenames and default to "MANUSCRIPT.tex" when necessary
  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Added regression test `test_write_manuscript_output_invalid_paths` to ensure edge cases are handled correctly
  - **End-to-End Verification**: Confirmed PDF generation pipeline now works correctly with successful BibTeX processing
- **GitHub Issues**: Resolves #100 (BibTeX returned error code 1)
