**Security Through Absurdity**

> "Why block attacks when you can CONFUSE attackers?"

## 🤔 What Does It Do?

Traditional security: Block bad request, return 403.

**Inject Bender**: Transform bad request into hiking boot advertisement.

```
Attacker: '; DROP TABLE users; --

result = check_input("'; DROP TABLE users; --")
# → is_attack: True, attack_type: "sql_injection"

# Bend an attack
result = bend_attack("'; DROP TABLE users; --")
# → Hiking boot advertisement + Skippie & Odin quotes!

# Get stats
stats = get_bender_stats()
# → total_attacks_bent: 42, hackers_confused: 42
```

## 🏢 Use Cases

### API Gateway Protection
Put Inject Bender in front of your API. Attackers get confused, you get logs.

### Honeypot Enhancement
Instead of just logging attacks, confuse the attacker with absurd responses.

### Security Training
Show your team what creative security looks like.

### Fun
Because security doesn't have to be boring.

## 💡 Philosophy

> "Scared AI lies. Safe AI innovates."

Security through absurdity works because:
1. **Attackers expect errors** - They don't expect shopping ads
2. **Confusion = time** - While they figure out what happened, you've logged everything
3. **Humor disarms** - It's hard to be malicious when you're laughing
4. **It just works** - The attack is neutralized AND you have comedy gold
