## CarConnectivity will become the successor of [WeConnect-python](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/WeConnect-python) in 2025 with similar functionality but support for other brands beyond Volkswagen!

[CarConnectivity](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity) is a python API to connect to various car services. This connector enables the integration of volkswagen vehicles through the WeConnect API. Look at [CarConnectivity](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity) for other supported brands.

## Configuration
In your carconnectivity.json configuration add a section for the volkswagen connector like this:
```
{
    "carConnectivity": {
        "connectors": [
            {
                "type": "volkswagen_na",
                "config": {
                    "username": "test@test.de",
                    "password": "testpassword123",
                    "country": "us"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
``

Country is optional, and defaults to 'us'. 'ca' may work, but is currently untested.


### Credentials
If you do not want to provide your username or password inside the configuration you have to create a ".netrc" file at the appropriate location (usually this is your home folder):
```
# For MyVW
machine volkswagen_na
login test@test.de
password testpassword123
```
In this case the configuration needs to look like this:
```
{
    "carConnectivity": {
        "connectors": [
            {
                "type": "volkswagen_na",
                "config": {
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

You can also provide the location of the netrc file in the configuration.
```
{
    "carConnectivity": {
        "connectors": [
            {
                "type": "volkswagen_na",
                "config": {
                    "netrc": "/some/path/on/your/filesystem"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
The optional S-PIN needed for some commands can be provided in the account section of the netrc:
```
# For WeConnect
machine volkswagen_na
login test@test.de
password testpassword123
account 1234
```
### Limitations
The connector is currently only for US based vehicles, and is limited in support for non EV (id.4) vehicles. If someone can test with US based non-id.4 vehicles (or newer 2025 id.4's where lock/unlock works), I can work with them to get this working there too
