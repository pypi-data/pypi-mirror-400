# TIBVH - Taichi-based Linear BVH

A high-performance Python package for 3D spatial data structures and geometry processing using Taichi for GPU acceleration.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Taichi 1.6.0+
- NumPy 1.19.0+
- PyTorch 1.10.0+

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TATP-233/tibvh.git
cd tibvh
pip install -e .
```

### Supported Geometry Types
