"""
Example: Finding Related Monitoring Stations for Dams

This example demonstrates how to use find_related_stations() to automatically
discover upstream or downstream monitoring stations related to a dam.

Key Features:
- Basin matching using watershed (유역) information (priority)
- Geographic search using Haversine distance (fallback)
- Access to both internal site_id and original facility codes
- Configurable search parameters (direction, distance, limit)

Use Cases:
- Identify monitoring stations for dam impact analysis
- Build upstream-downstream relationship datasets
- Cross-reference with external systems using original facility codes
