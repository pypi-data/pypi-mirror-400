# Welcome to BMDE

## Key Features

*   **Unified CLI:** Manage build, run, debug, and git operations from a single command.
*   **Docker Integration:** Run components in Docker containers without manual installation.
*   **Host Fallback:** Use local installations if preferred.
*   **Configuration Management:** Flexible configuration via TOML files and environment variables.
