/**
 * @brief A handle for a site.
 * @details An opaque pointer to an implementation of the QDMI site concept.
 * A site is a place that can potentially hold a qubit. In case of
 * superconducting qubits, sites can be used synonymously with qubits. In case
 * of neutral atoms, sites represent individual traps that can confine atoms.
 * Those atoms are then used as qubits. To this end, sites are generalizations
 * of qubits that denote locations where qubits can be placed on a device.
 * Each implementation of the @ref device_interface "QDMI Device Interface"
 * defines the actual implementation of the concept.
 *
 * A simple example of an implementation is a struct that merely contains the
 * site ID, which can be used to identify the site.
 * ```
 * struct MQT_SC_QDMI_Site_impl_d {
 *   size_t id;
 * };
 * ```

/**
 * @brief A handle for an operation.
 * @details An opaque pointer to an implementation of the QDMI operation
 * concept. An operation generally represents any instruction that can be
 * executed on a device. This includes gates, measurements, classical control
 * flow elements, movement of qubits, pulse-level instructions, etc.
 * Each implementation of the @ref device_interface "QDMI Device Interface"
 * defines the actual implementation of the concept.
 *
 * A simple example of an implementation is a struct that merely contains the
 * name of the operation, which can be used to identify the operation.
 * ```
 * struct MQT_SC_QDMI_Operation_impl_d {
 *   std::string name;
 * };
