    """
    Build a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph where each node is a cell.
    Edges are formed between cells that share one or more nearest neighbors, weighted by the number or importance of those shared neighbors.

    Args:
        x: 
            Numeric matrix where rows are dimensions and columns are cells,
            typically containing a low-dimensional representation from, e.g., :py:func:`~scranpy.run_pca`.

            Alternatively, a :py:class:`~knncolle.find_knn.FindKnnResults` object containing existing neighbor search results.

            Alternatively, a :py:class:`~knncolle.classes.Index` object.

        num_neighbors:
            Number of neighbors in the nearest-neighbor graph.
            Larger values generally result in broader clusters during community detection.
            Ignored if ``x`` is a :py:class:`~knncolle.find_knn.FindKnnResults` object. 

        weight_scheme:
            Weighting scheme to use for the edges of the SNN graph, based on the number or ranking of the shared nearest neighbors.

        num_threads:
            Number of threads to use.

        nn_parameters:
            The algorithm to use for the nearest-neighbor search.
            Only used if ``x`` is not a pre-built nearest-neighbor search index or a list of existing nearest-neighbor search results.

    Returns:
        A :py:class:`~biocutils.NamedList.NamedList` containing the components of a (possibly weighted) graph.

        - ``vertices``: integer specifying the number of vertices (i.e., cells) in the graph.
        - ``edges``: integer NumPy array containing the graph edges.
          Pairs of values represent the endpoints of an (undirected) edge, i.e., ``edges[0:2]`` form the first edge, ``edges[2:4]`` form the second edge and so on.
        - ``weights``: double-precision NumPy array of edge weights.
          This has length equal to half the length of ``edges``; the first weight corresponds to the first edge, and so on.
