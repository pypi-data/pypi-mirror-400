## Features

### Different input formats

SplitterMR can read data from multiples sources and files. To read the files, it uses the Reader components, which inherits from a Base abstract class, `BaseReader`. This object allows you to read the files as a properly formatted string, or convert the files into another format (such as `markdown` or `json`). 

Currently, there are supported three readers: `VanillaReader`, and `MarkItDownReader` and `DoclingReader`. These are the differences between each Reader component:

| **Reader**             | **Unstructured files & PDFs** | **MS Office suite files** | **Tabular data** | **Files with hierarchical schema** | **Image files** | **Markdown conversion** |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| [**`VanillaReader`**](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/reader/#vanillareader)    | `txt`, `md`, `pdf` | `xlsx`, `docx`, `pptx` | `csv`, `tsv`, `parquet` | `json`, `yaml`, `html`, `xml` | `jpg`, `png`, `webp`, `gif` | Yes                     |
| [**`MarkItDownReader`**](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/reader/#markitdownreader) | `txt`, `md`, `pdf` | `docx`, `xlsx`, `pptx` | `csv`, `tsv` | `json`, `html`, `xml`                    | `jpg`, `png`, `pneg`        | Yes                     |
| [**`DoclingReader`**](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/reader/#doclingreader)    | `txt`, `md`, `pdf` | `docx`, `xlsx`, `pptx` | –            | `html`, `xhtml`                 | `png`, `jpeg`, `tiff`, `bmp`, `webp` | Yes                     |

### Several splitting methods

SplitterMR allows you to split files in many different ways depending on your needs. The available splitting methods are described in the following table:

![SplitterMR architecture diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR/refs/heads/main/docs/assets/splitter_mr_architecture_diagram_white.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

**SplitterMR** is designed around a modular pipeline that processes files from raw data all the way to chunked, LLM-ready text. There are three main components: Readers, Models and Splitters.

- **Readers**
    - The **`BaseReader`** components read a file and optionally converts to other formats to subsequently conduct a splitting strategy.
    - Supported readers (e.g., **`VanillaReader`**, **`MarkItDownReader`**, **`DoclingReader`**) produce a `ReaderOutput` dictionary containing:
        - **Text** content (in `markdown`, `text`, `json` or another format).
        - Document **metadata**.
        - **Conversion** method.
- **Models:**
    - The **`BaseModel`** component is used to read non-text content using a Visual Language Model (VLM).
    - Supported models are `AzureOpenAI`, `OpenAI` and `Grok`, but more models will be available soon.
    - All the models have a `analyze_content` method which returns the LLM response based on a prompt, the client and the model parameters.
- **Splitters**
    - The **`BaseSplitter`** components take the **`ReaderOutput`** text content and divide that text into meaningful chunks for LLM or other downstream use.
    - Splitter classes (e.g., **`CharacterSplitter`**, **`SentenceSplitter`**, **`RecursiveCharacterSplitter`**, etc.) allow flexible chunking strategies with optional overlap and rich configuration.
- **Embedders**
    - The **`BaseEmbedder`** components are used to encode the text into embeddings. These embeddings are used to split text by semantic similarity.
    - Supported models are `AzureOpenAI` and `OpenAI`, but more models will be available soon.
    - All the models have a `encode_text` method which returns the embeddings based on a text, the client and the model parameters.

## How to install

Package is published on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/splitter-mr/).  

By default, only the **core dependencies** are installed. If you need additional features (e.g., MarkItDown, Docling, multimodal processing), you can install the corresponding **extras**.

### Core install

Installs the basic text splitting and file parsing features (lightweight, fast install):

```bash
pip install splitter-mr
```

### Optional extras

| Extra            | Description                                                                                                           | Example install command                 |

```

### Using other package managers

You can also install it with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [`conda`](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) or [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/):

```bash
uv add splitter-mr
```

!!! note
    
    **Python 3.11 or greater** is required to use this library.


## How to use

### Read files

Firstly, you need to instantiate an object from a BaseReader class, for example, `VanillaReader`.

```python
from splitter_mr.reader import VanillaReader

reader = VanillaReader()
```

To read any file, provide the file path within the `read()` method. If you use `DoclingReader` or `MarkItDownReader`, your files will be automatically parsed to markdown text format. The result of this reader will be a `ReaderOutput` object, a dictionary with the following shape:

```python 
reader_output = reader.read('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR/refs/heads/main/data/lorem_ipsum.txt')
print(reader_output)
```
```python
text='Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum sit amet ultricies orci. Nullam et tellus dui.', 
document_name='lorem_ipsum.txt',
document_path='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR/refs/heads/main/data/lorem_ipsum.txt', 
document_id='732b9530-3e41-4a1a-a4ea-1d9d6fe815d3', 
conversion_method='txt', 
reader_method='vanilla', 
ocr_method=None, 
page_placeholder=None,
metadata={}
```

!!! note
    Note that you can read from an URL, a variable and from a `file_path`. See [Developer guide](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/reader/).


### Split text

To split the text, first import the class that implements your desired splitting strategy (e.g., by characters, recursively, by headers, etc.). Then, create an instance of this class and call its `split` method, which is defined in the `BaseSplitter` class.

For example, we will split by characters with a maximum chunk size of 50, with an overlap between chunks:

```python
from splitter_mr.splitter import CharacterSplitter

char_splitter = CharacterSplitter(chunk_size=50, chunk_overlap = 10)
splitter_output = char_splitter.split(reader_output)
print(splitter_output)
```
```python
chunks=['Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing', 'adipiscing elit. Vestibulum sit amet ultricies orc', 'ricies orci. Nullam et tellus dui.'], 
chunk_id=['db454a9b-32aa-4fdc-9aab-8770cae99882', 'e67b427c-4bb0-4f28-96c2-7785f070d1c1', '6206a89d-efd1-4586-8889-95590a14645b'], 
document_name='lorem_ipsum.txt', 
document_path='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR/refs/heads/main/data/lorem_ipsum.txt', 
document_id='732b9530-3e41-4a1a-a4ea-1d9d6fe815d3', 
conversion_method='txt', 
reader_method='vanilla', 
ocr_method=None, 
split_method='character_splitter', 
split_params={'chunk_size': 50, 'chunk_overlap': 10}, 
metadata={}
```

The returned object is a `SplitterOutput` dataclass, which provides all the information you need to further process your data. You can easily add custom metadata, and you have access to details such as the document name, path, and type. Each chunk is uniquely identified by an UUID, allowing for easy traceability throughout your LLM workflow.

### Compatibility with vision tools for image processing and annotations

Pass a VLM model to any Reader via the `model` parameter:

```python
from splitter_mr.reader import VanillaReader
from splitter_mr.model.models import AzureOpenAIVisionModel

model = AzureOpenAIVisionModel()
reader = VanillaReader(model=model)
output = reader.read(file_path="data/sample_pdf.pdf")
print(output.text)
```

These VLMs can be used for captioning, annotation or text extraction. In fact, you can use these models to process the files as you want using the `prompt` parameter in the `read` method for every class which inherits from `BaseReader`.
