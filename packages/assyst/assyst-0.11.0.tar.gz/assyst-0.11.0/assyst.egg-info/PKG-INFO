# ASSYST or _Automated Small SYmmetric Structure Training_

A minimal reference implementation of ASSYST method to generate transferable training data for machine learning
potentials.

ASSYST is the Automated Small Symmetric Structure Training, a training protocol, aimed at providing comprehensive,
transferable training sets for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP) automatically. A detailed explanation and
verification of the method can be found in our papers.
[1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-025-01669-4)[2](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.104103) ASSYST gives up the notion of fitting potentials to
individual phases or structures and instead tries to deliver a training set spanning the full potential energy surface
(PES) of a material.

This software package is a minimal implementation of this idea, designed to be as flexible as possible without assuming
either a specific MLIP, reference data, or workflow manager in mind. It is built on
[ASE](https://ase-lib.org/index.html) and can use any of its calculators. It also assumes that you bring your own
reference energies and forces. For a ready-to-run implementation that targets Atomic Cluster Expansion and Moment Tensor
Potentials fit to Density Functional Theory (DFT) data check out pyiron_potentialfit.
