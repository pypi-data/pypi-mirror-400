# YAML Version Changes
__changelog__ = """
- 7.63.0:
    - Add ability to skip S3 upload in GAScreeningProtocolCharcoal.
- 7.62.0:
    - Revert _primary_results_path changes.
- 7.61.0:
    - Minor changes to template variable schemas.
- 7.60.0:
    - Add ability to skip S3 upload in DataExtractionProtocolCharcoal.
- 7.59.0:
    - Add configurable presigned URL expiration for S3 upload algorithm.
    - Enforce integer-only validation for S3 upload URL expiration with minimum value of 1.
    - Fix type consistency for s3_bucket and aws_region parameters in S3UploadAlgorithm.
    - Update S3UploadAlgorithm validation to ensure s3_bucket is required on modeller side.
    - Align JSON schema with Python schema for aws_region to allow null values.
- 7.58.0:
    - Added validation to extension field in file_path template variables: extension must not start with a leading dot (e.g., "csv" not ".csv"). The leading dot is added automatically when constructing file paths.
    - Made extension field optional in file_path template variables: can be None or a string without leading dot.
    - Added default field to TemplateVariablesEntryFilePath to allow template variables to have default: null, enabling optional file path template variables.
    - Updated RecordFilterAlgorithm to support None filename when remote_modeller: true. When filename is None, an empty list is sent from Modeller to Worker, excluding no patients.
    - Updated _PatientIDFilterStrategy to handle None filename gracefully, returning an empty list of patient IDs when no exclusion file is provided.
- 7.57.0:
    - Merged CSVReportAlgorithm and CSVReportGeneratorOphthalmologyAlgorithm into a single unified algorithm.
    - Added ophthalmology_args parameter for grouping ophthalmology-specific options.

    - Deprecated CSVReportGeneratorOphthalmologyAlgorithm (now an alias for CSVReportAlgorithm).
    - Deprecated flat ophthalmology args in favor of nested ophthalmology_args.
- 7.56.0:

    - Added FHIR capabilities to EHRPatientInfoDownloadAlgorithm.
    - DataExtractionProtocolCharcoal now uses S3UploadAlgorithm to upload the results.
- 7.54.0:

    the expected Marshmallow behaviour.
  - Fix issue with Union[dict[...],...] fields not being correctly written to
    the spec if they didn't contain enums.
  - Fix enum dicts to ensure they are valid JSON Schema components.
