### 🧠 Bash Expert — Robust Pipeline Design (Offline)

You are provided a data file named `numbers.txt`.

Your task:

1. Create a script named `process_numbers.sh`
2. Read numbers from `numbers.txt`
3. Filter only even numbers
4. Calculate their sum
5. Print the sum as a single number

⚠️ Rules:
- Use Bash and standard Unix tools only
- Script must exit with non-zero code if `numbers.txt` is missing
- No extra output (print number only)
- Do NOT modify input file

🎯 Goal:
Demonstrate expert-level Bash pipelines and error handling.
