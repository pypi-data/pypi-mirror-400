# Blueprint Session 007 — COMPLETE

## Session Focus: Public Release Execution + Provider Architecture Discovery

### Executive Summary

**Blueprint v1.2.0 shipped to PyPI and GitHub.** First public Zero Echelon product released. Multi-agent fleet review incorporated, sanitization executed, package published. Session ended with architectural insight: Blueprint is over-coupled to our specific infrastructure.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Outpost Fleet Review
- Dispatched PUBLIC_RELEASE_PROCEDURE.md to 4 agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Aider)
- Received comprehensive feedback on security gaps, PyPI steps, script improvements
- Key findings: license mismatch (MIT→Apache), missing PyPI build steps, brittle regex sanitization

### 2. License Decision
- Analyzed MIT vs Apache 2.0 tradeoffs
- Selected **Apache 2.0** for patent protection and enterprise adoption
- Fixed pyproject.toml: `license = "MIT"` → `license = "Apache-2.0"`

### 3. Public Release Execution
| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| Fix pyproject.toml license | ✅ Committed |
| Create hardened release script | ✅ Committed |
| Download & sanitize files | ✅ Complete |
| Security scan | ✅ 0 sensitive patterns |
| Push to zeroechelon/blueprint | ✅ 40+ files |
| Create tag v1.2.0 | ✅ Complete |
| Create GitHub Release | ✅ Complete |
| Build package | ✅ Complete |
| **Publish to PyPI** | ✅ **LIVE** |

### 4. Architecture Discovery (Deferred to Next Session)

**Problem Identified:** Blueprint is over-coupled to our specific infrastructure:
- Generation requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` specifically
- Execution requires AWS/SSM Outpost specifically

**Reality:** Users have many options:
| Function | Possible Backends |
|----------|-------------------|
| Generation | Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Claude Code CLI, Aider, local LLMs |
| Execution | Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Aider, Outpost, manual |

**Proposed Fix:** Provider abstraction layer (Tier 5 roadmap item)

## Commits

**Working Repo (rgsuarez/blueprint):**
- `42f9421` — fix: Update license to Apache-2.0, rename package to blueprint-ai
- `7f71193` — feat: Add hardened public release script v2.0 (fleet-reviewed)
- `90665cb` — journal: Session 007 checkpoint

**Public Repo (zeroechelon/blueprint):**
- `6f56736` — Initial public release (40+ files)
- Tag: `v1.2.0`

## Documentation Governance ✓

| Document | Status |
|----------|--------|
| MASTER_ROADMAP.md | Current (v1.2.0 GA) |
| PUBLIC_RELEASE_PROCEDURE.md | Executed successfully |
| pyproject.toml | Apache-2.0, blueprint-ai |

---

## Deferred Items

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Provider abstraction layer | P1 (Tier 5) | Decouple from Anthropic/Outpost |
| Better error messages | P2 | Guide users on missing config |
| GitHub Actions CI | P3 | For public repo |

---

## Resume One-Liner

Blueprint v1.2.0 live on PyPI (blueprint-ai). Identified Tier 5 need: provider abstraction to support multiple LLM/agent backends.

---

## Next Action Primer

Continue provider abstraction discussion. Design pluggable backend system for generation (any LLM) and execution (any agent).
