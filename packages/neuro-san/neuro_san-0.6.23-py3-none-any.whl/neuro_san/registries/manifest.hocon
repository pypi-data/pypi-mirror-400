    # The agent network .hocon files above are examples specific to the neuro-san library.
    #
    # It would be an Easy thing to do to add your own agent network's .hocon file to the
    # list above to get started, but 99% of the time it is not the Right, Simple thing to do
    # to make a commit with your agent listed here.
    # Why? Because many agent networks drag in dependencies for their CodedTools,
    # and we are continually trying to keep neuro-san a lean library.
    #
    # We are quite sure your agent is superlative and special... to you.
    # If your agent really is the 1% of cases which is so exemplary that we need to show it
    # off to the world, you will need to be talking to the neuro-san team to make it
    # the exemplary case you perhaps unintentionally end up meaning it to be by adding
    # it here, in the neuro-san repo.
    #
    # The Right thing to do is to start your own repo with your own registries/ directory,
    # with your own manifest.hocon file for your own agent network .hocon file projects,
    # and your own coded_tools directory for those agents.  And when you do that,
    # you will delete this set of comments, because you will have free reign in your own repo.
    # After all: Stallions must run, and run free.
    #
    # Use the AGENT_MANIFEST_FILE and AGENT_TOOL_PATH env vars to direct a generic neuro-san
    # server to your own repo's agents and CodedTools, respectively.
    #
    # See https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san-studio for an example of how to do this.
