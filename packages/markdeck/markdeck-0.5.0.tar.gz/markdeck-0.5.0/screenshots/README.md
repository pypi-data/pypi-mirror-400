## Generation

Screenshots are automatically generated by GitHub Actions when:
- Pull requests modify files in `markdeck/static/` or `examples/`
- Changes are pushed to these paths
- Manually triggered via the "Generate Screenshots" workflow

To manually generate screenshots locally (requires Playwright browsers):

```bash
# Start MarkDeck server
.venv/bin/markdeck present examples/features.md --port 8888 --no-browser &

# Generate grid view screenshots
python capture_screenshots.py

# Generate theme screenshots
python capture_theme_screenshots.py
```

**Note:** Local screenshot generation requires Playwright browsers to be installed, which may not work in environments with network restrictions. Use GitHub Actions for reliable screenshot generation.
