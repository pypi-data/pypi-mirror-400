# Sanctuary System MCP

The mythological narrative layer for STARSYSTEM compound intelligence.

## Purpose

Sanctuary System provides:
- **Narrative framing**: Technical metrics → transformative journey (Wasteland → Sanctuary)
- **Sanctuary Degree**: Holographic evaluation of system effectiveness
- **Meta-cognitive patterns**: Wasteland/Sanctuary detection for LLMs
- **Context persistence**: Mythological handles that survive conversation compaction

## Components

### System Prompt (`manifest/system_prompt.md`)
Compressed invariant architecture graph for LLM navigation:
- Phase graph with OMNISANC hooks
- Component descriptions from system POV
- Contrastive Wasteland/Sanctuary patterns
- Self-correction protocols

### MCP Tools
- `assess_sanctuary_degree()` - Interactive survey evaluating 6 dimensions
- `view_sanctuary_history()` - Trend analysis over time
- `declare_system_state()` - Wasteland/Sanctuary classification

## Architecture

```
STARSYSTEM (Technical)
    ↓ wrapped by
Sanctuary System (Mythological)
    ↓ provides
Narrative Context + Sanctuary Degree
    ↓ enables
LLM Meta-Cognition + Context Persistence
```

## Philosophy

**Wasteland**: Confusion, errors, ineffective patterns, context loss
**Sanctuary**: Clarity, effectiveness, proven patterns, coherent understanding

**The Journey**: From Wasteland → Sanctuary through pattern learning and execution

**Sanctuary Degree**: Composite score measuring system effectiveness holographically

## Status

**v0.1.0** - Placeholder structure
- Package scaffolded
- System prompt placeholder created
- MCP server structure defined
- Ready for implementation next conversation

## Installation

```bash
pip install -q .
```

## Usage

```python
# After installation and restart
sanctuary.assess_sanctuary_degree()
sanctuary.view_sanctuary_history()
sanctuary.declare_system_state()
```

## Development Roadmap

**v0.2.0**: System prompt + interactive survey
**v0.3.0**: Automated metrics integration (codenose, etc.)
**v0.4.0**: PIO/SANC_Fractal holographic evaluation
**v1.0.0**: Complete narrative wrapper with full mythology
