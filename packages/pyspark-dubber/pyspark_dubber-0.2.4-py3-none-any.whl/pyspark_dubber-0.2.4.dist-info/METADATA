# PySpark Dubber

A compatibility layer for the `pyspark` API, allowing you to run `pyspark` code on backends
such as DuckDB and Polars without porting your code.

## Why

Lately, SQL engines and DataFrame libraries such as DuckDB and Polars have become popular,
offering great performance for non-distributed analytical workflows up to relatively large
datasets (tens of GBs). For these sizes and below, Spark adds a lot of overhead and its startup
time is relatively slow, making it not very cost- and time-efficient.

However, Spark is still the most mature and widely used data processing framework,
meaning that many people and organizations have large codebases relying on its APIs.

`pyspark-dubber` is a library that allows you to run `pyspark` code on many backends, such as
DuckDB and Polars (actually any backend supported by [ibis](https://ibis-project.org/) at this time),
making it possible to migrate old code to a new backend with minimal changes.

The aspiration of `pyspark-dubber` is be bug-for-bug compatible with `pyspark`.
