"""Precision policy submodule for defining mixed precision behavior.

This submodule provides the Policy dataclass that defines the dtypes used for
different aspects of mixed precision computation: parameters, compute operations,
and outputs.

Policies can be created from simple or detailed string specifications, making
it easy to configure precision settings for different hardware and use cases.
