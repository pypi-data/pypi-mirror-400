        Sets the frequency at which this control will update.
        This is designated in Hertz, with a minimum of 20 Hz
        (every 50 ms) and a maximum of 1000 Hz (every 1 ms).
        Some update frequencies are not supported and will be
        promoted up to the next highest supported frequency.

        If this field is set to 0 Hz, the control request will
        be sent immediately as a one-shot frame. This may be useful
        for advanced applications that require outputs to be
        synchronized with data acquisition. In this case, we
        recommend not exceeding 50 ms between control calls.
