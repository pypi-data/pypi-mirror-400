Idea 1 – Lecture Event Summarizer and Embedded Study Assistant
	1.	Name: Event‑Aware Lecture Summarizer.
	2.	Value proposition: Provide students with real‑time, context‑aware summaries and retrieval of lecture segments using latent‑space vision‑language understanding rather than token‑by‑token generation.
	3.	Problem + users: Undergraduate courses often record lectures, yet students struggle to revisit relevant segments and compile concise notes.  Traditional video summarization tools produce generic summaries and require heavy hardware.  Target users are students and teaching staff who need real‑time summarization, event segmentation and Q&A around lecture videos.
	4.	Why VL‑JEPA is essential: VL‑JEPA’s ability to predict semantic embeddings without full decoding enables a system to process streaming lecture video on a laptop and produce continuous semantic embeddings.  Selective decoding triggers only when a new topic or important event (e.g., slide change, equation derivation) is detected, reducing computational load ￼.  Embedding‑space retrieval allows matching queries against the recorded lecture without generating long transcripts.  Existing generative models like LLaVA require full autoregressive captioning for each frame, leading to latency.
	5.	MVP scope (4–8 weeks):
	•	Integrate a V‑JEPA visual encoder and a frozen text embedding model to approximate VL‑JEPA until official weights are available.
	•	Real‑time ingestion of lecture video (screen capture or webcam) and sliding‑window computation of embeddings.
	•	Event boundary detection via embedding change rate; trigger the Y‑decoder (small language model) to produce short summaries only when significant semantic shifts occur.
	•	Index embeddings along with timestamps for search and retrieval.
	•	Simple question‑answering interface: embed student queries and compute similarity to recorded embeddings to retrieve relevant segments and decode answer labels.
	•	Export summaries and highlight key frames for study notes.
	6.	Example workflow:
	1.	Student starts the tool and streams a lecture video.  The X‑encoder encodes frames into embeddings; the predictor produces a latent representation conditioned on a generic “summarize” query.
	2.	When the embedding distance exceeds a threshold (e.g., new slide appears), the Y‑decoder generates a brief summary (one or two sentences).
	3.	After class, students type a question (e.g., “What equation defined the loss function?”).  The system embeds the question and performs nearest‑neighbor search across stored embeddings to locate relevant segments and returns the timestamp plus decoded answer.
	7.	Novelty check: Existing tools such as LAVIS or CLIP‑based summarizers generate transcripts and captions for every frame; they cannot do selective decoding or latent‑space event detection.  The Voice‑Vision‑Assistant‑for‑Blind focuses on object description and uses generic VLMs.  Our proposal differs by using latent embeddings to detect semantic changes and by combining summarization and retrieval within one unified embedding space.  Without VL‑JEPA, streaming summarization on CPU would be difficult.
	8.	Implementation plan:
	•	Stack: Use the open‑source V‑JEPA encoder (ViT‑L/16 checkpoint ￼) and a lightweight text encoder (e.g., MiniGemma or all‑MiniLM).  For the predictor, fine‑tune a small transformer (e.g., Llama‑3 8B) to map visual embeddings and queries to text embeddings.  Use PyTorch with Hugging Face transformers.  A simple Y‑decoder can be a small LLM (e.g., Gemma‑2B) to convert embeddings to natural language.
	•	Data sources: Use lecture recordings and slide images from openly licensed courses.  Embeddings and summaries stored locally; no raw video retained unless permitted.  Provide privacy controls.
	•	CPU fallback: If only CPU is available, reduce frame rate and window size and perform embedding‑only processing; summaries may be generated offline.  On GPU (consumer), process full frame rate and more frequent updates.
	•	Engineering tasks: (1) Build data pipeline for video capture, frame sampling and embedding; (2) implement predictor training with few‑shot lecture pairs; (3) implement event detection and selective decoding; (4) design search interface; (5) packaging as an open‑source web app or notebook.
	9.	Risks & mitigations:
	•	Model unavailability: If official VL‑JEPA weights aren’t released, results may lag behind; mitigate by using V‑JEPA + open text encoders and highlight limitations.
	•	Lecture privacy: Ensure recorded lectures are processed locally; include user‑controlled storage and deletion.
	•	Event detection accuracy: Embedding drift might not perfectly align with topic changes; incorporate manual correction or threshold tuning.
	•	Bias in summarization: Summaries may omit important details; allow users to adjust summarization granularity.
	10.	Evaluation plan: In a BSc AI class, test the tool on multiple recorded lectures.  Metrics: (a) Event detection precision/recall – compare detected segments against manual annotations; (b) Retrieval accuracy – measure recall@k for question retrieval tasks; (c) Latency – average time per frame on CPU vs. GPU; (d) Student feedback – survey satisfaction with summaries and search results.
