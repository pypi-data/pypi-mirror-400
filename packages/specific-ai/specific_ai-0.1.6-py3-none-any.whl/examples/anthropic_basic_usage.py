    # For example, let's write a prompt for classification of a question to one of two categories:
    PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
given the example, classify the reviews to one of two options according to their content, the optional categories are: 
Label 0: Negative 
Label 1: Positive 

always return only the numerical value for each review, meaning you will return a number either 0 or 1. 
for example: 0, another example: 1. no other talks.
