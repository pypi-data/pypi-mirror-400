argsjj commit -m 'test: add regression test for file permissions (issue #11)

Issue #11 reported that mode bits were not being copied. This was
resolved automatically when the plugin migrated from py.path to
pathlib.Path/shutil.copy in version 3.0, since shutil.copy preserves
mode bits by default.

This test ensures that file permissions continue to be preserved.'",
