# Full Configuration Example
#
# This example shows ALL available configuration options with their default values.
# Use this as a reference when customizing your setup.
#
# You don't need to specify every option - only include the ones you want to change
# from their defaults. The configuration system uses deep merging, so any missing
# values will automatically use the defaults shown here.

[tool.structure-lint]
# Master switch to enable/disable entire linter
enabled = true

[tool.structure-lint.validators]
# Control which validators are enabled
structure = false      # Opt-in (default: disabled) - enforces folder structure
line_limits = true     # Default: enabled - enforces max lines per file
one_per_file = true    # Default: enabled - enforces single definition per file

[tool.structure-lint.line_limits]
# Maximum number of lines allowed per Python file
max_lines = 150

# Directories to search for Python files (relative to project root)
# The tool automatically excludes: .venv/, __pycache__/, .git/, node_modules/
search_paths = ["src"]

[tool.structure-lint.one_per_file]
# Directories to search for Python files (relative to project root)
search_paths = ["src"]

[tool.structure-lint.structure]
# Name of the source code root directory
src_root = "src"

# Standard folders that can appear inside feature/module directories
# These represent common code organization patterns
standard_folders = ["types", "utils", "constants", "tests"]

# Name of the special "general" folder that can contain Python files directly
# Used for miscellaneous code that doesn't fit into standard folders
general_folder = "general"

# Top-level directories at project root that are exempt from all structure validation
# Useful for legacy code, experiments, or special-case directories
# Note: These are at project root level, not within src/
free_form_roots = []

# Non-Python files allowed in directories that normally shouldn't contain files
# Useful for documentation files in organizational directories
allowed_files = ["README.md"]

# ============================================================================
# Usage Examples:
# ============================================================================
#
# With this full default configuration, your project structure should look like:
#
# project/
# ├── pyproject.toml          (contains this configuration)
# ├── src/
# │   └── features/           (base folder)
# │       ├── authentication/ (feature directory)
# │       │   ├── types/      (standard folder)
# │       │   ├── utils/      (standard folder)
# │       │   ├── constants/  (standard folder)
# │       │   ├── tests/      (standard folder)
# │       │   └── general/    (general folder - can contain .py files)
# │       │       └── login.py
# │       └── reporting/      (another feature)
# │           └── ...
#
# ============================================================================
# Customization Tips:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Start minimal - only specify what you want to change from defaults
# 2. Use comments to document why you chose specific values
# 3. Adjust line_limits.max_lines based on your team's preferences
# 4. Customize standard_folders to match your architecture (e.g., MVC)
# 5. Use free_form_roots for legacy or experimental code at project root
# 6. Disable validators you don't want with false
#
