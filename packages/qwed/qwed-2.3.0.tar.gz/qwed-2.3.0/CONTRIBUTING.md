Thank you for your interest in contributing! Before you start, please read this guide to understand QWED's philosophy and avoid common misunderstandings.

## 📚 Required Reading (Before Contributing)

| File | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| [README.md](./README.md) | Understand what QWED is |
| [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) | System design and engine architecture |
| [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) | Community standards |
| [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) | How to report vulnerabilities |

## 🧠 Understanding QWED's Philosophy

### The Core Principle: Deterministic First

QWED is NOT just another LLM wrapper. Our philosophy:

1. **LLMs are untrusted translators** - They convert natural language to structured queries
2. **Symbolic engines are trusted verifiers** - SymPy, Z3, SQLGlot, etc. do the actual verification
3. **Determinism is required** - Given the same input, output must be identical every time
4. **LLM fallback is last resort** - Only when deterministic methods cannot handle the query

### ❌ Common Misunderstandings

| Wrong Approach | Correct Approach |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Let the LLM verify the math" | Use SymPy to compute, LLM only translates |
| "Add more LLM prompts to fix edge cases" | Add deterministic patterns/rules |
| "Cache LLM responses" | Deterministic verification doesn't need caching |
| "Trust LLM confidence scores" | Use symbolic proof verification |

## 🔧 Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/QWED-AI/qwed-verification.git
cd qwed-verification

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

## 🎯 Current Focus (Phase 1: Logic Verification)

We are building **symbolic execution capabilities**. Here are the priority issues:

| Priority | Issue | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 🔴 High | [#15 CrossHair Integration](https://github.com/QWED-AI/qwed-verification/issues/15) | Python-native symbolic execution |
| 🟡 Medium | [#16 Bounded Model Checking](https://github.com/QWED-AI/qwed-verification/issues/16) | Loop depth limits for path explosion |
| 🟢 Easy | Documentation improvements | Help improve docs |

**Pick an issue labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted` to get started!**

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Bugs

Open an issue with:
- QWED version (`pip show qwed`)
- Python version
- Input that caused the bug
- Expected vs actual output
- Full traceback

### 2. Proposing Features

Before coding, open an issue to discuss:
- What problem does it solve?
- Does it require LLM or is it deterministic?
- Which engine does it affect?

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qwed-verification.git

# 2. Create a branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature

# 3. Make changes

# 4. Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# 5. Commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat(engine): add capability X"

# 6. Push and create PR
git push origin feat/your-feature
```

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): description

feat(math): add matrix determinant support
fix(sql): handle nested subqueries
docs: update architecture diagram
test: add edge cases for logic engine
```
