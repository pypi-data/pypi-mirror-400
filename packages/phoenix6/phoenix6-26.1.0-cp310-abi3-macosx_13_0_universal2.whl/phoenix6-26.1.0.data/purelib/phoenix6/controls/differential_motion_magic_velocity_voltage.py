class DifferentialMotionMagicVelocityVoltage:
    """
    Requests Motion Magic® to target a final velocity using a motion profile, and
    PID to a differential position setpoint.  This allows smooth transitions between
    velocity set points.
    
    Motion Magic® Velocity produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting
    to honor the specified Acceleration and (optional) Jerk.  This control mode does
    not use the CruiseVelocity, Expo_kV, or Expo_kA configs.
    
    Acceleration and jerk are specified in the Motion Magic® persistent
    configuration values.  If Jerk is set to zero, Motion Magic® will produce a
    trapezoidal acceleration profile.
    
    Target velocity can also be changed on-the-fly and Motion Magic® will do its
    best to adjust the profile.  This control mode is voltage-based, so relevant
    closed-loop gains will use Volts for the numerator.

                       FOC improves motor performance by leveraging torque (current)
                       control.  However, this may be inconvenient for applications
                       that require specifying duty cycle or voltage. 
                       CTR-Electronics has developed a hybrid method that combines
                       the performances gains of FOC while still allowing
                       applications to provide duty cycle or voltage demand.  This
