# Research Overview

Veridex is grounded in academic research. We implement techniques directly from papers.

## Implemented Papers

### Text
- **DetectGPT**: *DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature* (Mitchell et al., 2023).
- **Binoculars**: *Binoculars: Zero-Shot Detection of LLM-Generated Text* (Hans et al., 2024).
- **DNA-GPT**: *DNA-GPT: Divergent N-Gram Analysis for Training-Free Detection of GPT-Generated Text* (Yang et al., 2023).

### Image
- **DIRE**: *DIRE for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection* (Wang et al., 2023).
- **CNN-generated images are surprisingly easy to spot...**: (Wang et al., 2020) - Basis for Frequency analysis.

### Audio
- **AASIST**: *AASIST: Audio Anti-Spoofing using Integrated Spectro-Temporal Graph Attention Networks* (Jung et al., 2022).

## Research Process

We actively monitor arXiv and other sources for new detection methods. When a promising paper is found:
1. We summarize it.
2. We create a prototype implementation.
3. We integrate it as a `Signal` in Veridex.

See the `project_notes/research` directory for raw summaries and notes.
