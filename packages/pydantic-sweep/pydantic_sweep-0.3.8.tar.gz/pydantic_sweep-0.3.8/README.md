# pydantic-sweep

`pydantic_sweep` is a library to programmatically, safely and flexibly define
complex parameter sweeps over `pydantic` models in Python.

**Highlights**:
- Specify parameter sweeps in Python
- Flexibility: specify complex parameter combinations by chaining simple functional operations
- Safety checks for parameter combinations (get meaningful errors early)
- `pydantic` field validation
- Conversion between json/yaml/python code representation of models

For example, the following code will instantiate models with `(x=5, sub=Sub1(s=1)` and
`(x=6, sub=Sub1(s=2)` and try each of those with seed values of `seed=43` and
`seed=44`, leading to four different configurations:

```python
import pydantic_sweep as ps

class Sub1(ps.BaseModel):
    s: int = 5

class Sub2(ps.BaseModel):
    y: str = "hi"

class Model(ps.BaseModel):
    seed: int = 42
    x: int = 5
    sub: Sub1 | Sub2

# We want to test across two seeds
configs = ps.config_product(
    ps.field("seed", [43, 44]),
    # And two specific Sub1 and `x` combinations
    ps.config_zip(
        ps.field("x", [ps.DefaultValue, 6]),
        ps.field("sub.s", [1, 2]),
    )
)
# This includes safety checks that Sub1 / Sub2 are uniquely specified
models = ps.initialize(Model, configs)

# The code above is equivalent to
models_manual = [
    Model(seed=43, sub=Sub1(s=1)),
    Model(seed=43, x=6, sub=Sub1(s=2)),
    Model(seed=44, sub=Sub1(s=1)),
    Model(seed=44, x=6, sub=Sub1(s=2)),
]
assert models == models_manual

# We can also check that we didn't accidentally duplicate a setting
ps.check_unique(models)
```

While in this toy example, manually specifying the combinations may still be viable,
the library allows infinitely combining different configs and sub-models, making it
a powerful tool for large-scale experiment definition.
