# Changelog

## rtflite 2.5.3

### Documentation

- Update mkdocstrings settings to render Pydantic field metadata
  via `griffe-pydantic` in API reference docs (#189).
- Declare `RTFDocument._table_space` as a Pydantic private attribute to
  prevent mkdocstrings render errors in static mode (#189).
- Add Code Wiki link as README badge and site navigation link.
  This is a useful resource that helps developers and AI agents
  understand the codebase fast (#191).

## rtflite 2.5.2

### Documentation

- Migrated documentation site to use Zensical (#184, #185).

## rtflite 2.5.1

### Testing

- Migrated the RTF snapshot tests implementation to a proper solution
  `pytest-r-snapshot` to reduce boilerplate code and improve maintainability.
  The legacy fixture generation workflow is removed and the snapshots are
  stored under the standard location `tests/__r_snapshots__/` (#181).

## rtflite 2.5.0

### New features

- Added `RTFDocument.write_html` and `RTFDocument.write_pdf` for exporting RTF
  documents to HTML and PDF via LibreOffice, matching the `write_docx`
  conversion workflow (#176).

### Testing

- Added parameterized tests covering DOCX, HTML, and PDF exports, with a
  new `pdf` extra (`pypdf`) for PDF text extraction.
  Improved LibreOffice availability checks to skip integration tests
  when conversion is not working (#176).

## rtflite 2.4.0

### Breaking changes

- Removed the `executable_path` argument from `RTFDocument.write_docx`; pass
  `converter=LibreOfficeConverter(executable_path=...)` instead (#172).

### Improvements

- `RTFDocument.write_docx` now accepts a `converter=` instance to configure
  LibreOffice invocation (including custom executable paths) and to enable
  reusing a converter across multiple conversions (#172).

### Converters

- `LibreOfficeConverter(executable_path=...)` now accepts `Path` objects
  and resolves executable names via `PATH` when given
  (for example, `"soffice"`) (#172).

## rtflite 2.3.1

### Improvements

- Added `executable_path` parameter to `write_docx()` method (#170).
- Added `/tmp/soffice` and `/tmp/libreoffice` paths for Linux (#170).

## rtflite 2.3.0

### New features

- Added `concatenate_docx` function to merge DOCX outputs without manual
  field refreshes, preserving per-section orientation (#160).

### Testing

- Added DOCX concatenation coverage and centralized optional dependency
  skip markers for `python-docx` and LibreOffice to keep tests gated
  appropriately (#160).

### Documentation

- Updated the assembly article to use `concatenate_docx` in code examples and
  added a reference page for assemble function to the documentation site (#160).

## rtflite 2.2.0

### New features

- Added `RTFDocument.write_docx` to export tables as DOCX via LibreOffice,
  with `str`/`Path` input support and automatic parent directory creation (#156).
- Improved `write_rtf` to accept `Path` inputs and create missing output
  directories (#156).

### Documentation

- Expanded DOCX assembly guidance with toggle field caveats and `python-docx`
  concatenation examples (#157).
- Documented installing the `docx` extra in the README and assemble article,
  including `uv sync --extra docx` for developers (#155).

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where `RTFPage` orientation was not correctly respected during assembly in certain edge cases (#141).

## rtflite 2.0.0

### Breaking changes

- Removed legacy pagination/encoding APIs, including `ContentDistributor`,
  `PageDict`/`AdvancedPaginationService`, and the `SinglePageStrategy`/
  `PaginatedStrategy` classes; dropped backwards-compatibility helpers
  such as `text_convert` and `get_color_index` (#138).

### Refactors

- Introduced a unified rendering pipeline (`UnifiedRTFEncoder`) with a strategy
  registry, page feature processor, and renderer that handle pagination,
  borders, and page headers consistently, including combined `page_by` and
  `subline_by` grouping (#138).
- Simplified public exports by re-exporting `RTFEncodingEngine`,
  `TableAttributes`, `RTFSubline`, and `get_string_width` from the top-level
  package while reorganizing core config/constants imports (#138).

### Testing and documentation

- Added regression tests for combined grouping and `page_by` column alignment,
  and removed obsolete advanced pagination tests; cleaned up RTF doc fixtures
  and trimmed pagination reference docs to match the new architecture (#138).

## rtflite 1.2.0

### Bug fixes

- Fixed `page_by` pagination when using `RTFPage(orientation="landscape")`,
  covering single- and multi-page tables and aligning documentation examples
  (#128, #131, #134).

### Maintenance

- Added GitHub Actions workflow to run `ruff check` for code linting,
  updated GitHub Actions workflows to use `actions/checkout@v6`,
  and updated badges in `README.md` (#133).

  R and hexSticker dependency (#111).

### Typing

- Adopted modern typing best practices: use `|` unions instead of
  `Union`/`Optional`, and built-in generics instead of `typing` aliases (#95).
- Resolved all mypy issues; type checks now pass cleanly (#97, #99, #101).
- Added a mypy GitHub Actions workflow for continuous type checking (#100).

### Testing
