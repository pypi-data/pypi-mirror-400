A powerful, high-level Python wrapper for managing and testing V2Ray/Xray-core and Hysteria clients.

This library abstracts the complexities of binary management, multi-format config parsing, and concurrent connection testing, providing a clean and streamlined API for developers.

## ✨ Features


-   **Automated Binary Management**: Automatically downloads and manages the necessary `Xray-core`, `Hysteria`, and test engine binaries for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
-   **Intelligent Subscription Handling**: Effortlessly import configurations from subscription links. The loader intelligently handles both Base64 and plain-text formats and includes a powerful deduplication engine to clean up redundant profiles.
-   **Unified Config Parser**: Seamlessly parses various link formats (`vless`, `vmess`, `trojan`, `ss`, `hysteria2`, `mvless`) into a standardized Python object model.
-   **High-Speed Concurrent Testing**: Utilizes a hybrid architecture (Python + Go) to test dozens of configurations simultaneously, reporting latency, download, and upload speeds in seconds.
-   **Dynamic Config Builder**: A fluent builder API to programmatically construct complex Xray JSON configurations with custom inbounds, outbounds, and routing rules.
-   **Advanced Proxy Chaining ("WARP on Any")**: Easily route any configuration's traffic (VLESS, Trojan, even another WireGuard) through a final WARP outbound for enhanced privacy and connectivity.
-   **Live Statistics**: Connect to a running Xray-core instance's gRPC API to fetch live traffic statistics (uplink & downlink).
-   **Cross-Platform**: Designed to work flawlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

## 🚀 Installation

Install the latest stable version from PyPI:

```bash
pip install python-v2ray
```

## ⚡️ Quick Start: Test a List of Proxies

This example demonstrates the core functionality: downloading dependencies, parsing URIs, and running a connection test. For more advanced examples, please see our [full documentation](https://arshiacomplus.github.io/docs/python-v2ray/).
