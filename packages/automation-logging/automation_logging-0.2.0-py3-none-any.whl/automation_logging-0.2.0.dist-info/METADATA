# Automation Logging

## Overview 
Logging library for automation, offering thread-safety, log cleanup and screenshot support:
* **Thread-Safe Logging:** Ensures reliable and consistent logging from multi-threaded applications, preventing message corruption.
* **Automated Log Management:** Simplifies log file maintenance with configurable retention policies based on age or file count.
* **Seamless Integration:** Enables effortless integration with existing projects by allowing the library to override the standard `logging` module's root logger.
* **Integrated Screenshot Capture:** Captures informative screenshots directly within your logs, supporting full-screen captures (using `pyautogui`) and Selenium WebDriver screenshots, including headless browser support (using `selenium`).
* **Performance Profiling:** Capture elapsed and CPU times of functions using decorators and log the results.
