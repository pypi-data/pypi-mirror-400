# DYNAMIC Fire risk indicator implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the dynamic fire risk indicator is based upon the research paper:

R.D. Strand and L.M. Kristensen: *An implementation, evaluation and validation of a dynamic fire and conflagration risk indicator for wooden homes*. In volume 238 of Procedia Computer Science, pp. 49-56, 2024. Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies Networks (ANT). Online:  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705092401233X

The fire risk indicator uses forecast and weather data observations for computing fire risk indication in the form of time-to-flash-over (ttf) for wooden houses. 

# Weather Data Sources

The implementation has been designed to be independent of any particular cloud-based weather data service. 

This library contains an implementation that use the weather data services provided by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET):

- MET Frost API for weather data observations: https://frost.met.no/index.html
- MET Forecasting API for weather data forecasts: https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/documentation 

To use these pre-implemented clients a file name `.env` must be place in your project folder having the following content:

```
MET_CLIENT_ID = '<INSERT CLIENT ID HERE>'
MET_CLIENT_SECRET = '<INSERT CLIENT SECRET HERE>'
```

Credentials for using the MET APIs can be obtained via: https://frost.met.no/auth/requestCredentials.html

Please make sure that you conform to the terms of service which includes restrictions on the number of API calls.

# Example usage

The following Python script shows how to use the `FireRiskPrediction` class to compute fire risks for a given location:


```python
import datetime

from frcm.frcapi import METFireRiskAPI
from frcm.datamodel.model import Location

# sample code illustrating how to use the Fire Risk Computation API (FRCAPI)
if __name__ == "__main__":

    frc = METFireRiskAPI()

    location = Location(latitude=60.383, longitude=5.3327)  # Bergen
    # location = Location(latitude=59.4225, longitude=5.2480)  # Haugesund

    # days into the past to retrieve observed weather data
    obs_delta = datetime.timedelta(days=2)

    wd = frc.get_weatherdata_now(location, obs_delta)
    print (wd)

    predictions = frc.compute_now(location, obs_delta)

    print(predictions)
```

and should result in an output similar to what is listed below showing hourly computed fire risks for the given location.

```

The above Python script if put into a file `main.py` can for instance be run in a virtual environment as follows:

```
python3 -m venv testenv
source testenv/bin/activate
pip install dynamic-frcm
python3 main.py
```

# API and implementation

The following methods are the main services currently being provided by the API:

- `get_weatherdata_now(location: Location, obs_delta: datetime.timedelta) -> WeatherData` - which provided with a location and a weather data observation time delta fetches weather data observations `obs_delta` into the past and concatenates this with the weather data from the current weather forecast for the location.
- `compute(wd: WeatherData) -> FireRiskPrediction` - which computes a fire risk predication based on the provided weather data.
- `compute_now(location: Location, obs_delta: datetime.timedelta) -> FireRiskPrediction` - which computes a fire risk predication for the current point in time using weather data observations `obs_delta` into the past. 

The source code for the library is available at via the `Download files` and is organised into the following main folders:

- `datamodel` - contains an implementation of the data model used for weather data and fire risk indications
- `weatherdata` contains an client implementations and interfaces for fetching weather data from cloud services.
- `fireriskmodel` contains an implementation of the underlying fire risk model
T
The main API for the implementation is in the file `frcapi.py`
