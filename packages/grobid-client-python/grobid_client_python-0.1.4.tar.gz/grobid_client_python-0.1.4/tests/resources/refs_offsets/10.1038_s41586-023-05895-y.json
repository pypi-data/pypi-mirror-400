        "text": "Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in segmental duplications (SDs) have not been systematically assessed because of the limitations of mapping short-read sequencing data 1,2 . Here we constructed 1:1 unambiguous alignments spanning high-identity SDs across 102 human haplotypes and compared the pattern of SNVs between unique and duplicated regions 3,4 . We find that human SNVs are elevated 60% in SDs compared to unique regions and estimate that at least 23% of this increase is due to interlocus gene conversion (IGC) with up to 4.3 megabase pairs of SD sequence converted on average per human haplotype. We develop a genome-wide map of IGC donors and acceptors, including 498 acceptor and 454 donor hotspots affecting the exons of about 800 protein-coding genes. These include 171 genes that have 'relocated' on average 1.61 megabase pairs in a subset of human haplotypes. Using a coalescent framework, we show that SD regions are slightly evolutionarily older when compared to unique sequences, probably owing to IGC. SNVs in SDs, however, show a distinct mutational spectrum: a 27.1% increase in transversions that convert cytosine to guanine or the reverse across all triplet contexts and a 7.6% reduction in the frequency of CpGassociated mutations when compared to unique DNA. We reason that these distinct mutational properties help to maintain an overall higher GC content of SD DNA compared to that of unique DNA, probably driven by GC-biased conversion between paralogous sequences 5,6 .",

Although these consortia helped to establish the genome-wide pattern of SNVs (as low as 0.1% allele frequency) and linkage disequilibrium on the basis of sequencing and genotyping thousands of human genomes, not all parts of the human genome could be equally ascertained. Approximately 10-15% of the human genome 8 has remained inaccessible to these types of analysis either because of gaps in the human genome sequence or, more frequently, the low mapping quality associated with aligning short-read whole-genome sequencing data. This is because short-read sequence data are of insufficient length (<200 base pairs (bp)) to unambiguously assign reads and, therefore, variants to specific loci 9 . Although certain classes of large, highly identical repeats (for example, α-satellites in centromeres) were readily recognized, others, especially SDs 1 and their 859 associated genes 10 , in euchromatin were much more problematic to recognize.",

As such regions arise by duplication as opposed to retrotransposition, they were initially difficult to identify and early versions of the human genome sequence had either missed or misassembled these regions owing to their high sequence identity 12,13 . Large-insert BAC clones ultimately led to many of these regions being resolved. Subsequent analyses showed that SDs contribute disproportionately to copy number polymorphisms and disease structural variation 9,14 , are hotspots for gene conversion 15 , are substantially enriched in GC-rich DNA and Alu repeats 16,17 , and are transcriptionally diverse leading to the emergence, in some cases, of human-specific genes thought to be important for human adaptation [18][19][20][21] . Despite their importance, the pattern of SNVs among humans has remained poorly characterized. Early on, paralogous sequence variants were misclassified as SNVs 2 and, as a result, later high-identity SDs became blacklisted from SNV analyses because short-read sequence data could not be uniquely placed 22,23  . This exclusion has translated into a fundamental lack of understanding in mutational processes precisely in regions predicted to be more mutable owing to the action of IGC [24][25][26][27][28] . Previously, we noted an increase in SNV density in duplicated regions when compared to unique regions of the genome on the basis of our comparison of GRCh38 and the complete telomere-to-telomere",

First, we searched for regions of collapse 11 by identifying unusual increases or decreases in sequence read depth 3 . We determine that, on average, only 1.64 Mbp (1.37%) of the analysed SD sequence was suspect owing to unusually high or low sequence read depth on the basis of mapping of underlying read data-as such patterns are often indicative of a misassembly 3 (Methods). Next, for all SD regions used in our analysis we compared the predicted copy number by Illumina sequence read depth with the sum based on the total copy number from the two assembled haplotypes. These orthogonal copy number estimates were highly correlated (Pearson's R = 0.99, P < 2.2 × 10 -16 ; Supplementary Fig. 1) implying that most SD sequences in the assemblies have the correct copy number. To confirm these results in even the most difficult to assemble duplications, we selected 19 of the largest and most identical SDs across 47 haplotypes for a total of 893 tests. These estimates were also highly correlated (Pearson's R = 0.99, P < 2.2 × 10 -16 ; Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3), and of the 893 tests conducted, 756 were identical. For the 137 tests for which estimates differed, most (n = 125) differed by only one copy. Finally, most of these discrepancies came from just three large (>140 kbp) and highly identical (>99.3%) SDs (Supplementary Fig. 3).",

Both unique (average quality value = 59 s.d. 1.9) and SD (average quality value = 53 s.d. 1.9) regions are remarkably high quality, which in the case of SDs translates into less than 1 SNV error every 200 kbp (Supplementary Fig. 4). We further show that these high-quality assembles result in accurate variant calls (Supplementary Notes and Supplementary Figs. 56789). We also assessed the contiguity of the underlying assemblies using a recently developed tool, GAVISUNK, which compares unique k-mer distributions between HiFi-based assemblies and orthogonal Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing data from the same samples. We found that, on average, only 0.11% of assayable SD sequence was in error compared to 0.14% of unique regions assayed (Supplementary Table 2), implying high and comparable assembly contiguity. As a final control for potential haplotype-phasing errors introduced by trio HiFi assembly of diploid samples, we generated deep Oxford Nanopore Technologies and HiFi data from a second complete hydatidiform mole (CHM1) for which a single paternal haplotype was present and applied a different assembly algorithm 32 (Verkko 1.0; Extended Data Fig. 2). We show across our many analyses that the results from the CHM1 Verkko assembly are consistent with individual haplotypes obtained from diploid HPRC samples produced by trio hifiasm 3,32 (Supplementary Fig. 10). We therefore conclude that phasing errors have, at most, a negligible effect on our results and that most (>98%) SDs analysed were accurately assembled from multiple human genomes allowing the pattern of SNV diversity in SDs to be systematically interrogated.",

      "text": "To assess SNVs, we limited our analysis to portions of the genome where a 1:1 orthologous relationship could be unambiguously assigned (as opposed to regions with extensive copy number variation). Using the T2T-CHM13 reference genome, we aligned the HPRC haplotypes requiring alignments to be a minimum of 1 Mbp in length and carry no structural variation events greater than 10 kbp (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1). Although the proportion of haplotypes compared for any locus varied (Fig. 1a), the procedure allowed us to establish, on average, 120.2 Mbp 1:1 fully aligned sequence per genome for SD regions out of a total of 217 Mbp from the finished human genome (T2T-CHM13 v1.1). We repeated the analysis for 'unique' (or single-copy) regions of the genome and recovered by comparison 2,508 Mbp as 1:1 alignments (Fig. 1a). All downstream analyses were then carried out using this orthologous alignment set. We first compared the SNV diversity between unique and duplicated regions excluding suboptimal alignments mapping to tandem repeats or homopolymer stretches. Overall, we observe a significant 60% increase in SNVs in SD regions (Methods; Pearson's chi-squared test with Yates's continuity correction P < 2.2 × 10 -16 ; Fig. 1b). Specifically, we observe an average of 15.3 SNVs per 10 kbp versus 9.57 SNVs per 10 kbp for unique sequences (Fig. 1d). An empirical cumulative distribution comparing the number of SNVs in 10-kbp windows between SD and unique sequence confirms that this is a general property and not driven simply by outliers. The empirical cumulative distribution shows that more than half of the SD sequences have more SNVs than their unique counterparts (Fig. 1b). Moreover, for all haplotypes we divided the unique portions of the genome into 125-Mbp bins and found that all SD bins of equivalent size have more SNVs than any of the bins of unique sequence (empirical P value < 0.0005; Extended Data Fig. 3). This elevation in SNVs is only modestly affected by the sequence identity of the underlying SDs (Pearson's correlation of only 0.008; Supplementary Fig. 11). The increase in SNVs (60%) in SDs is greater than that in all other assayable classes of repeats: Alu (23%), L1 (-9.4%), human endogenous retroviruses (-9.4%) and ancient SDs for which the divergence is greater than 10% (12%) (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3). We find, however, that SNV density correlates with increasing GC content (Supplementary Fig. 12) consistent with Alu repeats representing the only other class of common repeat to show an elevation.",

To confirm this observation in our data, we examined the number of SNVs per 10 kbp of unique sequence in African versus non-African haplotypes (Fig. 1c,d) and observed a 27% (10.8 versus 8.5) excess in African haplotypes. As a result, among African haplotypes, we see that the average distance between SNVs (979 bp) is 19.4% closer than in non-African haplotypes (1,215 bp), as expected 8,12 . African genomes also show increased variation in SDs, but it is less pronounced with an average distance of 784 bases between consecutive SNVs as compared to 909 bases in non-African haplotypes (13.8%). Although elevated in African haplotypes, SNV density is higher in SD sequence across populations and these properties are not driven by a few sites but, once again, are a genome-wide feature. We put forward three possible hypotheses to account for this increase although note these are not mutually exclusive: SDs have unique mutational mechanisms that increase SNVs; SDs have a deeper average coalescence than unique parts of the genome; and differences in sequence composition (for example, GC richness) make SDs more prone to particular classes of mutation.",

To identify regions of IGC, we developed a method that compares two independent alignment strategies to pinpoint regions where the orthologous alignment of an SD sequence is inferior to an independent alignment of the sequence without flanking information (Fig. 2a and Methods). We note several limitations of our approach (Supplementary Notes); however, we show that our high-confidence IGC calls (20+ supporting SNVs) have strong overlap with other methods for identifying IGC (Supplementary Notes and Supplementary Fig. 13). Using this approach, we created a genome-wide map of putative large IGC events for all of the HPRC haplotypes for which 1:1 orthologous relationships could be established (Fig. 2).",

It has been recognized for almost two decades that human SDs are particularly biased towards Alu repeats and GC-rich DNA of the human genome 16,40 . Notably, among the SNVs in SDs, we observed a significant excess of transversions (transition/transversion ratio (Ti/Tv) = 1.78) when compared to unique sequence (Ti/Tv = 2.06; P < 2.2 × 10 -16 , Pearson's chi-squared test with Yates's continuity correction). Increased mutability of GC-rich DNA is expected and may explain, in part, the increased variation in SDs and transversion bias 6,27,41 . Using a more complete genome, we compared the GC composition of unique and duplicated DNA specifically for the regions considered in this analysis. We find that, on average, 42.4% of the analysed SD regions are guanine or cytosine (43.0% across all SDs) when compared to 40.8% of the unique DNA (P value < 2.2 × 10 -16 , one-sided t-test). Notably, this enrichment drops slightly (41.8%) if we exclude IGC regions. Consequently, we observe an increase of all GC-containing triplets in SD sequences compared to unique regions of the genome (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, the enrichment levels of particular triplet contexts in SD sequence correlate with the mutability of the same triplet sequence in unique regions of the genome (Pearson's R = 0.77, P = 2.4 × 10 -7 ; Fig. 5b). This effect is primarily driven by CpG-containing triplets, which are enriched between 14 and 30% in SD sequences. Note, we observe a weaker and insignificant correlation for the non-CpG-containing triplets (Pearson's R = 0.22, P = 0.27). Extrapolating from the mutational frequencies seen in unique sequences, we estimate that there is 3.21% more variation with SDs due to their sequence composition alone.",

A linear model containing all pairwise interactions of these predictors was able to explain 10.5% of the variation in SNVs per 10 kbp (adjusted R 2 ), whereas a model containing only the number of IGC events explained only 1.8% of the variation. We note that this measure of variance is related but not directly comparable to the finding that the elevation in the number of SNVs is reduced by 23% when excluding IGC regions. All of the random variables, including their pairwise interactions, were significant (P value < 0.05) predictors of SNVs per 10 kbp except the interaction of number of IGC events with GC content, copy number and TMRCA. The strongest single predictors were the number of unique IGC events and the divergence of the overlapping SD (Supplementary Table 14).",

      "text": "Since the first publications of the human genome 12,13 , the pattern of single-nucleotide variation in recently duplicated sequence has been difficult to ascertain, leading to errors 2,11 . Later, indirect approaches were used to infer true SNVs in SDs, but these were far from complete 40 . More often than not, large-scale sequencing efforts simply excluded such regions in an effort to prevent paralogous sequence variants from contaminating single-nucleotide polymorphism databases and leading to false genetic associations 8,23 . The use of phased genome assemblies as opposed to aligned sequence reads had the advantage of allowing us to establish 1:1 orthologous relationships as well as the ability to discern the effect of IGC while comparing the pattern of single-nucleotide variation for both duplicated and unique DNA within the same haplotypes. As a result, we identify over 1.99 million nonredundant SNVs in a gene-rich portion of the genome previously considered largely inaccessible. SNV density is significantly elevated (60%) in duplicated DNA when compared to unique DNA consistent with suggestions from primate genome comparisons and more recent de novo mutation studies from long-read sequencing data [46][47][48] . Furthermore, an increased de novo mutation rate in SDs could support our observation of an elevated SNV density without the need for an increase in TMRCA. We estimate that at least 23% of this increase is due to the action of IGC between paralogous sequences that essentially diversify allelic copies through concerted evolution. IGC in SDs seems to be more pervasive in the human genome compared to earlier estimates 15,27 , which owing to mapping uncertainties or gaps could assay only a smaller subset of regions 15,27 . We estimate more than 32,000 candidate regions (including 799 protein-coding genes) with the average human haplotype showing 1,192 events when compared to the reference. The putative IGC events are also much larger (mean 6.26 kbp) than those of most previous reports 28,49 , with the top 10% of the size distribution >14.4 kbp in length. This has the net effect that entire genes are copied hundreds of kilobase pairs into a new genomic context when compared to the reference. The effect of such 'repositioning events' on gene regulation will be an interesting avenue of future research.",

Although we classify these regions as putative IGC events, other mutational processes such as deletion followed by duplicative transposition could, in principle, generate the same signal creating large tracts of 'repositioned' DNA. It should also be stressed that our method simply relies on the discovery of a closer match within the reference; by definition, this limits the detection of IGC events to regions where the donor sequence is already present in the reference as opposed to an alternative. Moreover, we interrogated only regions where 1:1 synteny could be unambiguously established. As more of the genome is assessed in the context of a pangenome reference framework, we anticipate that the proportion of IGC will increase, especially as large-copy-number polymorphic SDs, centromeres and acrocentric DNA become fully sequence resolved 3 . Although we estimate 4.3 Mbp of IGC in SDs on average per human haplotype, we caution that this almost certainly represents a lower bound and should not yet be regarded as a rate until more of the genome is surveyed and studies are carried out in the context of parent-child trios to observe germline events.",

In this study, we show that there is a clear skew in the mutational spectrum of SNVs to maintain this property of SDs beyond expectations from unique DNA. This property and the unexpected Ti/Tv ratio cannot be explained by lower accuracy of the assembly of SD regions. We find a 27.1% increase in transversions that convert cytosine to guanine or the reverse across all triplet contexts. GC-rich DNA has long been regarded as hypermutable. For example, C>G mutations preferentially associate with double-strand breaks in humans and apes 42,43 and GC-rich regions in yeast show about 2-5 times more mutations depending on sequence context compared to AT-rich DNA 41 . Notably, in human SD regions, we observe a paucity of CpG transition mutations, characteristically associated with spontaneous deamination of CpG dinucleotides and concomitant transitions 6 . The basis for this is unclear, but it may be partially explained by the recent observation that duplicated genes show a greater degree of hypomethylation when compared to their unique counterparts 10 . We propose that excess of guanosine and cytosine transversions is a direct consequence of GC-biased gene conversion 5 driven by an excess of double-strand breaks that result from a high rate of nonallelic homologous recombination events and other break-induced replication mechanisms among paralogous sequences.",

Large, recently duplicated segments are prone to copy number variation and are also susceptible to collapse and misassembly owing to their repetitive nature. HPRC haplotypes were assembled using PacBio HiFi with hifiasm 3,54 creating contiguous long-read assemblies. We selected 19 SD loci corresponding to genes that were known to be duplicated and copy number variable in the human species. We k-merized the 2 haplotype assemblies corresponding to each locus for each individual into k-mers of 31 base pairs in length. We then computed copy number estimates over each locus for the sum haplotype assemblies and calculated the difference based on Illumina WGS from the same sample. For both datasets, we derived these estimates using FastCN, an algorithm implementing whole-genome shotgun sequence detection 55 . When averaging across each region and comparing differences in assembly copy versus Illumina WGS copy estimate, we observe that 756 out of 893 tests were perfectly matched (δ = 0), suggesting that most of these assemblies correctly represent the underlying genomic sequence of the samples.",

This eliminates large forms of structural variation, including copy number variants or regions of large-scale inversion restricting the analysis to largely copy number invariant SD regions (about 120 Mbp) and flanking unique sequence. Once these syntenic alignments were defined, we carried out a second alignment fragmenting the 1:1 synteny blocks into 1-kbp windows (100-bp increments) and remapped back to T2T-CHM13 to identify each window's single best alignment position. These second alignments were then compared to original syntenic ones and if they no longer overlapped, we considered them to be candidate IGC regions. Adjacent IGC windows were subsequently merged into larger intervals when windows continued to be mapped non-syntenically with respect to the original alignment. We then used the CIGAR string to identify the number of matching and mismatching bases at the 'donor' site and compared that to the number of matching and mismatching bases at the acceptor site determined by the syntenic alignment. A donor sequence is, thus, defined as a segment in T2T-CHM13 that now maps with higher sequence identity to a new location in the human haplotype (alignment method 2) and the acceptor sequence is the segment in T2T-CHM13 that has an orthologous mapping to the same region in the human haplotype (alignment method 1).
