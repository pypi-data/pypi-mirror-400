## File based Routes (Optional) 

**Virtual routes `.virtual_routes.md`**

A virtual route generates a page from aggregated data sources, giving you greater control over the request and response.
Just add `.virtual_routes.md` file in the `contents/pages` directory.

**JSON response** 

any pattern that begins with the default API name are automatically returning JSON.

```md
/api/some_data/{data_id:str}: 
    GET.response: application/json
    data: hello {request.path_param.data_id} world
```

results from request `http:0.0.0.0/api/some_data/a3b3c3`

```json
{
  "data": "hello a3b3c3 world"
}
```

**HTML response**

The `page` attribute value will be passed into the page request. The page url and slug are auto set from the request.
Any scalar values will be passed as the page contents value. Only GET requests permitted by default.

```md
/products/{tag:str}:
    title: Products grouped by tag.
    contents: Listing of all products grouped by tags.
    template: product-tags.html
    entries: $dir/../products?groupby={request.path_params[tag])}
```
