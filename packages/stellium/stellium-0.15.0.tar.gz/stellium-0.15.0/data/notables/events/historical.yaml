  subcategories:

  notable_for: American historical event, the shooting of John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, on Friday, 22 November 1963 at 12:30 p.m. CST in Dallas, Texas while he was riding in a presidential motorcade in Dealey Plaza. Kennedy was riding with his wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally's wife, Nellie, and was fatally shot by former U.S. Marine Lee Harvey Oswald. A ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission from November 1963 to September 1964 concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, and that Jack Ruby also acted alone when he killed Oswald before he could stand trial. Kennedy's death marked the fourth (following those of Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley) and most recent assassination of an American President. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson automatically became President upon Kennedy's death.

  subcategories:

  notable_for: Russian nuclear power planet explosion. Reactor No.4 exploded and caught fire, contaminating vast areas of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus and spewing a radioactive cloud over Europe. The Kremlin tried to conceal the accident and delayed evacuation of people from nearby towns for days. Firefighters and other workers who were the first at the destroyed reactor had little or no protection from radiation. More than 4,000 cleanup workers died and 70,000 were disabled by radiation in Ukraine alone. About 3.4 million of Ukraine's 50 million population are considered affected. The Ukraine will suffer effects of the accident for years to come. Millions of its citizens are affected by radiation-related ailments. Since the accident, the planet experienced many malfunctions, and it was an immense relief to not only the Ukraine but the people of the world when the plant was closed 14 years later.
