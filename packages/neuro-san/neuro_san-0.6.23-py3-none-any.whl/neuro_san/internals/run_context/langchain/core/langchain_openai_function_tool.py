    Class which represents an OpenAI Function as a langchain BaseTool.

    to OpenAI function JSON in the langchain internals, but the idea
    is to have something at a higher level that plays well with
    the langchain Agent infrastructure.

    When this Tool's _arun() gets called, this allows the
    CallingTool (as ToolCaller) to set up other instances
    of LLM/Agent/AgentExecutor/RunContext to handle the tool call
    within that new context, but still within the async method chain.

        and do them all in a separate AgentExecutor context.
        Since this method is a langchain "a" method, all of these
        calls to another llm/agent instance happen asynchronously.
        ("a" is for asynchronous).
