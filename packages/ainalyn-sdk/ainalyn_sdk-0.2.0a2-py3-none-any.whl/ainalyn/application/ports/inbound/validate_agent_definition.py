    ⚠️ CRITICAL PLATFORM BOUNDARY WARNING ⚠️

    SDK validation success does NOT guarantee platform execution.
    The Ainalyn Platform applies additional checks during submission:
    - Governance policies
    - Security scanning
    - Resource quota validation
    - Marketplace compliance

    This validation only ensures the definition is structurally
    and semantically correct according to SDK rules.

    Per platform constitution: "Local compilation ≠ Platform execution"
    See: https://docs.ainalyn.io/sdk/platform-boundaries/

    Attributes:
        errors: Tuple of all validation issues found, including
            both errors and warnings.
