# Introduction

`filecache` is a Python module that abstracts away the location where files used or
generated by a program are stored. Files can be on the local file system (`/` or
`file://`), in Google Cloud Storage (`gs://`), on Amazon Web Services S3 (`s3://`), or on a
webserver (`http://` or `https://`). There is also a fake remote that can be used to simulate
a remote using the local filesystem as a file repository (`fake://`). When files to be read
are on the local file system, they are simply accessed in-place. Otherwise, they are
downloaded from the remote source to a local temporary directory. When files to be written
are on the local file system, they are simply written in-place. Otherwise, they are
written to a local temporary directory and then uploaded to the remote location (it is not
possible to upload to a webserver). When a cache is no longer needed, it is deleted from
the local disk.

`filecache` is a product of the [PDS Ring-Moon Systems Node](https://pds-rings.seti.org).

# Installation

The `filecache` module is available via the `rms-filecache` package on PyPI and can be
installed with:

```sh
pip install rms-filecache
```

# Getting Started

The top-level file organization is provided by the `FileCache` class. A `FileCache`
instance is used to specify a particular **sharing policy** and **lifetime**. For example,
a cache could be private to the current process and group a set of files that all have the
same basic purpose. Once these files have been (downloaded and) read, they are deleted as
a group. Another cache could be shared among all processes on the current machine and
group a set of files that are needed by multiple processes, thus allowing them to be
downloaded from a remote source only one time, saving time and bandwidth.

A `FileCache` can be instantiated either directly or as a context manager. When
instantiated directly, the programmer is responsible for calling `FileCache.delete_cache`
directly to delete the cache when finished (a non-shared cache will be automatically
deleted on program exit). When instantiated as a context manager, a non-shared cache is
deleted on exit from the context. See the class documentation for full details.

Usage examples:

```python
from filecache import FileCache
# Create a cache with a unique name that will be deleted on exit
with FileCache(None) as fc:  # Use as context manager
    # Also use open() as a context manager
    with fc.open('gs://rms-filecache-tests/subdir1/subdir2a/binary1.bin', 'rb',
                 anonymous=True) as fp:
        bin1 = fp.read()
    with fc.open('s3://rms-filecache-tests/subdir1/subdir2a/binary1.bin', 'rb',
                 anonymous=True) as fp:
        bin2 = fp.read()
    assert bin1 == bin2
# Cache automatically deleted here

fc = FileCache(None)  # Use without context manager
# Also retrieve file without using open context manager
path1 = fc.retrieve('gs://rms-filecache-tests/subdir1/subdir2a/binary1.bin',
                    anonymous=True)
with open(path1, 'rb') as fp:
    bin1 = fp.read()
path2 = fc.retrieve('s3://rms-filecache-tests/subdir1/subdir2a/binary1.bin',
                    anonymous=True)
with open(path2, 'rb') as fp:
    bin2 = fp.read()
fc.delete_cache()  # Cache manually deleted here
assert bin1 == bin2

# Write a file to a bucket and read it back
with FileCache(None) as fc:
    with fc.open('gs://my-writable-bucket/output.txt', 'w') as fp:
        fp.write('A')
# The cache will be deleted here so the file will have to be downloaded
with FileCache(None) as fc:
    with fc.open('gs://my-writable-bucket/output.txt', 'r') as fp:
        print(fp.read())
```

The `FCPath` class is a reimplementation of the Python `Path` class to support remote
acess using an associated `FileCache`. Like `Path`, an `FCPath` instance can contain any
part of a URI, but only an absolute URI can be used when actually accessing the file
specified by the `FCPath`. In addition, an `FCPath` can encapsulate various arguments such
as `anonymous` and `time_out` so that they do not need to be specified to each access
method. Thus, using this class can simplify the use of a `FileCache` by allowing the user
to operate on paths using the simpler syntax provided by `Path`, and to not specify
various other parameters at each method call site. If an `FCPath` instance is created
without an explicitly-associated `FileCache`, then the default `FileCache()` is used,
which specifies a shared cache named `"global"` that will persist after the program exits.

Compare this example to the one above:

```python
from filecache import FileCache, FCPath
# Create a cache with a unique name that will be deleted on exit
with FileCache(None) as fc:  # Use as context manager
    # Use GS by specifying the bucket name and one directory level
    p1 = fc.new_path('gs://rms-filecache-tests/subdir1', anonymous=True)
    # Access GS using a directory + filename (since only one directory level
    # was specified by the FCPath)
    # The additional filename is specified by using the / operator to create a new
    # FCPath instance; anonymous=True is inherited
    # Also use open() as a context manager
    with (p1 / 'subdir2a/binary1.bin').open('rb') as fp:
        bin1 = fp.read()
    # Access S3 using a filename only (since two directory levels were already
    # specified by the FCPath)
    with (p2 / 'binary1.bin').open('rb') as fp:
        bin2 = fp.read()
    assert bin1 == bin2
# Cache automatically deleted here
```

A benefit of the abstraction is that different environments can access the same files in
different ways without needing to change the program code. For example, consider a program
that needs to access the file ``COISS_2xxx/COISS_2001/voldesc.cat`` from the NASA PDS
archives. This file might be stored on the local disk in the user's home directory in a
subdirectory called ``pds3-holdings``. Or if the user does not have a local copy, it is
accessible from a webserver at
``https://pds-rings.seti.org/holdings/volumes/COISS_2xxx/COISS_2001/voldesc.cat``.
Finally, it could be accessible from Google Cloud Storage from the ``rms-node-holdings``
bucket at
``gs://rms-node-holdings/pds3-holdings/volumes/COISS_2xxx/COISS_2001/voldesc.cat``. Before
running the program, an environment variable could be set to one of these values:

```sh
$ export PDS3_HOLDINGS_SRC="~/pds3-holdings"
$ export PDS3_HOLDINGS_SRC="https://pds-rings.seti.org/holdings"
$ export PDS3_HOLDINGS_SRC="gs://rms-node-holdings/pds3-holdings"
```

Then the program could be written as:

```python
from filecache import FileCache
import os
with FileCache(None) as fc:
    p = fc.new_path(os.getenv('PDS3_HOLDINGS_SRC'))
    voldesc_path = p / 'volumes/COISS_2xxx/COISS_2001/voldesc.cat'
    contents = voldesc_path.read_text()
# Cache automatically deleted here
```

If the program was going to be run multiple times in a row, or multiple copies were going
to be run simultaneously, using a shared cache would allow all of the processes to share
the same copy, thus requiring only a single download no matter how many times the program
was run. A shared cache is indicated by giving the cache a name (or no argument, which
defaults to ``"global"``); also `FCPath` defaults to using the global cache if no
`FileCache` is specified. This results in the simplest form of the program:

```python
from filecache import FCPath
import os
p = FCPath(os.getenv('PDS3_HOLDINGS_DIR'))
voldesc_path = p / 'volumes/COISS_2xxx/COISS_2001/voldesc.cat'
contents = voldesc_path.read_text()
```

Finally, there are five classes that allow direct access to the five possible storage
locations without invoking any caching behavior: `FileCacheSourceFile`,
`FileCacheSourceHTTP`, `FileCacheSourceGS`, `FileSourceCacheS3`, and `FileCacheSourceFake`.
The first four provide access to real storage locations, while `FileCacheSourceFake`
simulates a remote source for testing purposes:

```python
from filecache import FileCacheSourceGS, FileCacheSourceFake
src1 = FileCacheSourceGS('gs://rms-filecache-tests', anonymous=True)
src1.retrieve('subdir1/subdir2a/binary1.bin', 'local_file1.bin')
src2 = FileCacheSourceFake('fake://fake-bucket')
src2.retrieve('subdir1/subdir2a/binary1.bin', 'local_file2.bin')
```

Details of each class are available in the [module documentation](https://rms-filecache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html).
