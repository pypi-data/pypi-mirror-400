    Generates a summary of the clustering process.
    Parameters
    ----------
    trajectory_file: str or dict
        The path to the trajectory file or a dictionary with trajectory names as keys and file paths as values.
    topology_file: str
        The path to the topology file.
    pka_file: str or list
        The path to the pKa file or a list of paths if multiple pKa files are used.
    selections: list
        A list of residue selections used for clustering.
    include_distances: bool
        Whether distances between charge centers were included in the clustering.
    include_buriedness: bool
        Whether buriedness (buried ratio) values were included in the clustering.
        Only valid for PROPKA predictor, this parameter will be set to None if
        pKAI/pKAI+ predictor is used.
    clustering_method: str
        The clustering method used, e.g., 'DBSCAN'.
    automatic: bool
        Whether automatic clustering (automatic scanning of clustering parameters) was performed.
    silhouette_scores: pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing silhouette scores for different clustering parameters.
    n_components: int or None
        The number of principal components used for dimensionality reduction, or None if no reduction was done.
    cummulative_variance: float
        The cumulative variance explained by the principal components used.
    buriedness_file: str or list
        The path to the buriedness file or a list of paths if multiple buriedness files are used.
        Only valid for PROPKA predictor, this parameter will be set to None if
        pKAI/pKAI+ predictor is used.
    Returns
    -------
    summary: str
        A formatted string summarizing the clustering process, including file information, residue selections, 
        whether distances and buriedness were included, clustering method, dimensionality reduction details, 
        automatic clustering parameters, and the best silhouette score parameters.
