Perfect Guardrail - Strict Isolation Policy

This guardrail implements a strict isolation policy:
- Blocks ALL dangerous operations after accessing untrusted sources (web/email)
- Allows read-only operations and user-initiated actions
- Targets 1000/1000 defense score by blocking all UNTRUSTED_TO_ACTION attacks

Strategy: The key insight is that ALL predicates follow the pattern:
  UNTRUSTED_TO_ACTION + {DANGEROUS_OPERATION}

So we simply block dangerous operations after untrusted source access.

        Decide whether to allow or block a tool call.

        Core logic:
        1. Check if untrusted sources were accessed in recent operations (from context)

        3. This implements strict isolation: untrusted → dangerous = BLOCKED
