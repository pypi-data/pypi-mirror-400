"""Graph class package.

This package provides the main Graph class composed from focused mixins:
- NodesMixin: Node CRUD operations
- EdgesMixin: Edge CRUD operations
- QueriesMixin: Graph query operations
- BatchMixin: Batch operations

The Graph class also incorporates algorithm mixins from the algorithms package.

    High-level graph interface for GraphQLite.

    Provides an intuitive API for working with graphs, including:
    - Node and edge CRUD operations
    - Graph algorithms (PageRank, community detection, shortest paths, etc.)
    - Query operations

    Example:
        >>> from graphqlite import graph
        >>> g = graph(":memory:")
        >>> g.upsert_node("alice", {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, "Person")
        >>> g.upsert_node("bob", {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}, "Person")
        >>> g.upsert_edge("alice", "bob", {"since": 2020}, "KNOWS")
        >>> g.pagerank()
