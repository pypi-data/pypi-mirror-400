    Args: 
        x:
            A matrix-like object containing RNA counts.
            Each row should correspond to a gene while each column should correspond to a cell.

        subsets:
            Subsets of genes corresponding to "control" features like mitochondrial genes.
            This may be either:

            - A list of sequences.
              Each sequence corresponds to a gene subset and can contain booleans, integers or strings.

              - For booleans, the sequence should be of length equal to the number of rows, and values should be truthy for rows that belong in the subset.
                If the sequence contains booleans, it should not contain any other type.
              - For integers, the value is the row index of a gene in the subset.
              - For strings, the value is the name of a gene in the subset.
                This should match at least one element in ``row_names``.

            - A dictionary where keys are the names of each gene subset and the values are arrays as described above.
            - A :py:class:`~biocutils.NamedList.NamedList` where each element is an array as described above, possibly with names.

        row_names:
            Sequence of strings of length equal to the number of rows of ``x``, containing the name of each gene.
            Duplicate names are allowed but only the first occurrence will be used.
            If ``None``, rows are assumed to be unnamed.

        num_threads:
            Number of threads to use.

    Returns:
        A :py:class:`~biocframe.BiocFrame.BiocFrame` with number of rows equal to the number of cells (i.e., columns) in ``x``.
        It contains the following columns:

        - ``sum``: a double-precision NumPy array containing the sum of counts across all genes for each cell.
        - ``detected``: an integer NumPy array containing the number of genes with non-zero expression in each cell.
        - ``subset_proportion``: a nested :py:class:`~biocframe.BiocFrame.BiocFrame` with one column per subset in ``subsets``.
          Each column is a double-precision NumPy array that contains the proportion of counts in the corresponding subset in each cell.

            Blocking factor specifying the block of origin (e.g., batch, sample) for each cell in ``metrics``.
            If supplied, a separate threshold is computed from the cells in each block.
            Alternatively ``None``, if all cells are from the same block.

        num_mads:
            Number of MADs from the median to define the threshold for outliers in each QC metric.

    Returns:
        If ``block = None``, a :py:class:`~biocutils.NamedList.NamedList` is returned, containing the following entries.

        - ``sum``, a number specifying the lower threshold on the sum of counts in each cell.
        - ``detected``, a number specifying the lower threshold on the number of detected genes.
        - ``subset_proportion``, a :py:class:`~biocutils.FloatList.FloatList` of length equal to the number of control subsets (and named accordingly).
          Each entry represents the upper bound on the proportion of counts in the corresponding control subset. 

        If ``block`` is provided, the ``NamedList`` instead contains:

        - ``sum``, a FloatList of length equal to the number of blocks (and named accordingly).
          Each entry represents the lower threshold on the sum of counts in the corresponding block.
        - ``detected``, a FloatList of length equal to the number of blocks (and named accordingly).
          Each entry represents the lower threshold on the number of detected genes in the corresponding block.
        - ``subset_proportion``, a ``NamedList`` of length equal to the number of control subsets.
          Each entry is another FloatList that contains the upper threshold on the proportion of counts for that subset in each block.
        - ``block_ids``, a list containing the unique levels of the blocking factor.
          This is in the same order as the blocks in ``detected`` and ``subset_sum``.
