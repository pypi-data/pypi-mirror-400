        This mixin exists primarily for legacy backward compatibility.

    This mixin provides additional date utilities primarily focused on:
    - Financial date calculations (nearest month start/end)
    - Weekday-oriented date navigation
    - Relative date lookups

    These methods extend OpenDate functionality with features commonly
