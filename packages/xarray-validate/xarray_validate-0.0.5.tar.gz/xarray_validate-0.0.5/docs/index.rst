Welcome to the xarray-validate documentation!


Motivation
----------

This is a maintained refactor of
`xarray-schema <https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray-schema>`_.
I needed an xarray validation engine for one of my projects. I saw in the
xarray-schema library a good start, but both its maintenance status and the
foreseen integration of its feature set into the much larger Pandera library
seemed uncertain. I therefore decided to fork the project, refactor it and add
the features I was missing.

Features
--------

* ⬆️ DataArray and Dataset validation
* ⬆️ Basic Python type serialization / deserialization
* Construct schema from existing xarray data
* 🚫 JSON roundtrip (not guaranteed to work)

⬆️ Inherited from xarray-schema
🚫 Won't do / won't fix

Installation
------------

Required dependencies:

* Python 3.8 or later
* xarray 2024 or later

Install from PyPI in your virtual environment:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install xarray-validate

Available extras:

* ``yaml``: Load schemas from YAML files.
* ``units``: Validate unit values in attributes using the Pint library.
* ``dask``: Validate xarray containers based on dask arrays (experimental).

To install all extras:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install "xarray-validate[all]"

Development installation:

.. code:: shell

    uv sync --dev --all-extras
