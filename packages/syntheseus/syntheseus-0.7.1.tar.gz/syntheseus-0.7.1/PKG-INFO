## Overview

Syntheseus is a package for end-to-end retrosynthetic planning.
- ⚒️ Combines search algorithms and reaction models in a standardized way
- 🧭 Includes implementations of common search algorithms
- 🧪 Includes wrappers for state-of-the-art reaction models
- ⚙️ Exposes a simple API to plug in custom models and algorithms
- 📈 Can be used to benchmark components of a retrosynthesis pipeline

## Quick Start

To install `syntheseus` with all the extras, run

```bash
conda env create -f environment_full.yml
conda activate syntheseus-full

pip install "syntheseus[all]"
```

This sample environment pins `torch` to version `2.2.2`. To run the models under `1.x` please downgrade to `syntheseus 0.6.0`.

See [here](https://microsoft.github.io/syntheseus/stable/installation) if you prefer a more lightweight installation that only includes the parts you actually need.

## Citation and usage

Since the release of our package, we've been thrilled to see syntheseus be used in the following projects:

## Development

Syntheseus is currently under active development.
If you want to help us develop syntheseus please install and run `pre-commit`
checks before committing code.

We use `pytest` for testing. Please make sure tests pass on your branch before
submitting a PR (and try to maintain high test coverage).

```bash
python -m pytest --cov syntheseus/tests
```
