    Requires Phoenix Pro;
    Request PID to target position with torque current feedforward.
    
    This control mode will set the motor's position setpoint to the position
    specified by the user. In addition, it will apply an additional torque current
    as an arbitrary feedforward value.
    
    :param position: Position to drive toward in rotations.
    :type position: rotation
    :param velocity: Velocity to drive toward in rotations per second. This is
                     typically used for motion profiles generated by the robot
                     program.
    :type velocity: rotations_per_second
    :param feed_forward: Feedforward to apply in torque current in Amperes. This is
                         added to the output of the onboard feedforward terms.
                         
                         User can use motor's kT to scale Newton-meter to Amperes.
    :type feed_forward: ampere
    :param slot: Select which gains are applied by selecting the slot.  Use the
                 configuration api to set the gain values for the selected slot
                 before enabling this feature. Slot must be within [0,2].
    :type slot: int
    :param override_coast_dur_neutral: Set to true to coast the rotor when output is
                                       zero (or within deadband).  Set to false to
                                       use the NeutralMode configuration setting
                                       (default). This flag exists to provide the

    :type override_coast_dur_neutral: bool
    :param limit_forward_motion: Set to true to force forward limiting.  This allows

                                 to robot controller.  This also allows use of
                                 active sensors that require external power.
    :type limit_forward_motion: bool
    :param limit_reverse_motion: Set to true to force reverse limiting.  This allows
                                 users to use other limit switch sensors connected
                                 to robot controller.  This also allows use of

                                   the LimitForwardMotion and LimitReverseMotion
                                   parameters, instead allowing motion.
                                   
                                   This can be useful on mechanisms such as an
                                   intake/feeder, where a limit switch stops motion
                                   while intaking but should be ignored when feeding
                                   to a shooter.

                                   This can be useful when calibrating the zero
                                   point of a mechanism such as an elevator.
                                   
                                   The software limit faults will still report the
