Use Cases / Context
===================

| In some RMA processes, especially in repair and refurbishment
  businesses, returned products may come from outside suppliers or
  unknown sources.
| While these products didn't originate from your inventory, you may
  still need to:

- Assign a unique lot/serial number upon receipt
- Track the product through repairs, testing, and resale
- Print and attach labels for internal traceability

This module automates lot/serial assignment at RMA confirmation for
tracked products, ensuring every returned item is properly identified
before it enters your warehouse workflow.

Configuration
=============

1. Go to **RMA / Configuration / Operations**
2. Open or create an RMA operation and:

   - Enable **Auto-create Lot/Serial on Confirm**
   - Select the **Lot/Serial Name Sequence** to use for generated lots

Optionally set Removal Days Before Expiration to automatically compute
the lot’s Removal Date as Expiration minus N days. Requires a positive
Lot Expiration (days).

Usage
=====

1. **Create an RMA** for a tracked product (lot or serial) without
   specifying an existing lot
2. Assign an **RMA Operation** that has:

   - Auto-create Lot/Serial enabled
   - A Lot Sequence defined

3. Confirm the RMA

   - The system will generate a new stock lot using the defined sequence
   - The lot will be linked to the RMA

If configured, the lot will receive Expiration and Removal date
(removal_date = expiration_date − N days).
