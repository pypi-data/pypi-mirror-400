# PyPass by rewind

Local, offline password manager written in Python with a CustomTkinter GUI.  
PyPass Secure stores all vault data in an encrypted SQLite database on your machine, without any cloud or network dependencies.

---

## Features

- **Local-only password vault**
  - All data stored in a local `.db` file
  - No cloud sync, no external servers, no network access

- **Secure encryption**
  - Master password used to derive an encryption key via PBKDF2 (SHA-256)
  - Random salt stored securely (Windows Registry or config file)
  - All stored passwords encrypted with Fernet (symmetric encryption)

- **Safe master password handling**
  - Master password is **never stored**, only used to derive keys in memory
  - Vault is created on first run and protected by your master password

- **Modern UI**
  - Built with [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter)
  - Simple, clean interface for adding, viewing, and managing credentials

- **Cross-platform**
  - Works on Windows and Linux
  - Windows: Uses Registry for salt storage
  - Linux: Uses `~/.pypass/config.dat` for salt storage

- **Offline by design**
  - No internet connection required
  - Ideal for users who prefer complete local control over their vault

## Installation

### Option 1: Install via pip (Recommended)

```bash
pip install pypass-secure
```

Then run:

```bash
pypass
```

### Option 2: Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rewindthetime/pypass.git
cd pypass
pip install -e .
```

Then run:

```bash
pypass
```

## Security Overview

PyPass Secure is designed as a **local, offline** password manager with a straightforward security model:

- **Key derivation**
  - User chooses a **master password** on first run.
  - A random **salt** is generated and stored securely.
    - Windows: In the Registry (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\PyPass`)
    - Linux: In `~/.pypass/config.dat`
  - The encryption key is derived using **PBKDF2 with SHA-256** and the master password + salt.
  - The master password itself is **never written** to disk.

- **Encryption**
  - The derived key is used for **Fernet** encryption.
  - Each password entry stored in the SQLite database is encrypted before being saved.
  - Decryption happens in memory only after the user successfully unlocks the vault.

- **Storage**
  - The vault is a local SQLite `.db` file.
  - The database contains only encrypted password data (no plaintext passwords).

- **No recovery**
  - If the master password is lost or forgotten, **the data cannot be decrypted**.
  - There is no backdoor, no recovery key, and no remote reset option.

> **Important:** PyPass Secure improves security compared to storing passwords in plain text,
> but its overall security also depends on your system security (user account, malware protection, backups, etc.).

## Requirements

- **Operating system**
  - Windows 10 or later
  - Linux (most distributions)

- **Runtime**
  - Python 3.10 or later

- **Python packages** (installed automatically via pip)
  - `cryptography`
  - `customtkinter`
  - `pillow`

- **Linux only:** Tkinter system package
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`
  - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S tk`

---

## Usage

### First Run

1. Run `pypass` from your terminal
2. Create a **master password** (make sure to remember it!)
3. A new vault database will be created
4. A random salt will be generated and stored securely

### Subsequent Runs

1. Run `pypass` from your terminal
2. Enter your **master password** to unlock the vault
3. The main UI opens where you can:
   - Add new password entries
   - View existing entries
   - Delete entries
   - Toggle password visibility

## Limitations & Important Notes

- **No cloud, no sync**
  - Vault data is stored **only on your local machine**.
  - There is **no automatic backup** or synchronization between devices.

- **No password recovery**
  - If you **forget or lose your master password**, the vault **cannot be decrypted**.
  - There is no recovery option. You will have to delete the vault file and start over.

- **Local system security**
  - PyPass Secure does not protect against keyloggers, screen recorders, or compromised operating systems.
  - Ensure that your user account, antivirus, and general system security are properly maintained.

---

## Warnings

- **Do not forget your master password.**
  - The master password is the **only** way to derive the key to decrypt your vault.
  - Losing it means **permanent loss of access** to all stored passwords.

- **Back up your vault file carefully.**
  - You may manually back up the SQLite `.db` file.
  - For a full restore to another system, also backup:
    - Windows: The Registry entry `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\PyPass`
    - Linux: The `~/.pypass/config.dat` file
  - Treat backups with the same level of security as the original vault.

- **Use a strong master password.**
  - Choose a long and unique password that you do not reuse elsewhere.
  - Anyone who knows your master password and has access to the vault file can decrypt your data.
