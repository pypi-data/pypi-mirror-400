  "response_body": "To calibrate your spaceship's thrusters, you'll need to follow a step-by-step process to ensure optimal performance. First, make sure the ship is powered down and in a safe environment. Next, access the thruster control panel and initiate the calibration mode. The system will prompt you to run a series of test firings at different power levels. Monitor the output readings and adjust the alignment as needed until the readings are within the recommended range. Once all tests pass, save the calibration settings and restart the system. Let me know if you need more detailed instructions on any of these steps."
