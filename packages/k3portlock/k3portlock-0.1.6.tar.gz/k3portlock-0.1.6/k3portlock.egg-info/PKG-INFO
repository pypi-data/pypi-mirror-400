k3portlock is a cross-process lock that is implemented with `tcp` port binding.

k3portlock is a component of [pykit3] project: a python3 toolkit set.


k3portlock is a cross-process lock that is implemented with `tcp` port binding.
Since no two processes could bind on a same TCP port.

k3portlock tries to bind **3** ports on loopback ip `127.0.0.1`.
If a k3portlock instance succeeds on binding **2** ports out of 3,
it is considered this instance has acquired the lock.




# Install
