    Encapsulated logic for syncretizing subtrees of a hybrid tree to avoid

    1. For every tree T, find all candidates (base, extension) such that base
       and extension are children of T and base is a prefix of extension. Add
       all such candidates to a list.
    2. Sort the candidates (base, extension) first by the difference in height
       (so those with a smaller difference are first), then by the total height
       of extension (so the largest children are first).
    3. Iterate through the sorted candidates and attempt to syncretize each
       pair in order. Each pair will require additional checks at this time
       since other attempts that occur first may make later attempts invalid
       (e.g. because base or extension has already been syncretized onto
       a different child).

    A mapping of operators that can be split up into two rounds of aggregation
    as part of an AGG-AGG syncretization. The key is the aggregation operator
    being used in the original extension child and the value is a tuple of two
    operators,  one of which should be used to aggregate the new extension
    child of the base child, and the other which should be used to aggregate
    the first aggregation within the base child.

    For example, if the parent has children C0 and C1, C0 has agg terms
    {"agg_0": COUNT()}, and C1 has agg terms {"agg_1": COUNT()}, then
    after syncretization, C0 will have a child with the suffix from C1
    (lets call this C2) with agg terms {"agg_2": COUNT()}, and C0 will
    now have the following: {"agg_0": COUNT(), "agg_1": SUM(agg_2)}.

    If an operator is not in this mapping then such a syncretization is not
    allowed because the aggregation cannot be split up into two rounds. An
    example of this is computing NDISTINCT or MEDIAN, since there is no
    aggregation that can be computed on the extension child such that the
    result can be re-aggregated to obtain the final result. An exception to
    this rule is AVG, which is specially handled since it can be decomposed
    into SUM and COUNT, both of which can be split.
