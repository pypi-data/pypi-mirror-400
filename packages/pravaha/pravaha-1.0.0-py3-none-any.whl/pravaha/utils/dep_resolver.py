"""
Using Depth first traversal algorithm.
How we are resolving dependencies?

Function Parameter: Takes a tuple of task names.
Returns Dictionary

Step 1: Fetching all the task from the task registry.
Step 2: Making a data-type for resolved tasks.
Step 3: Making a data-type for visited tasks.
Step 4: Creating a dfs function.
-> Takes task-name as argument.
-> Checking the task is visited if it do then we simply returns.
-> Checking the task exists in the registry or not if not we raise an exception.
-> Now resolving the dependency because it is a depth first search algo.
-> So we are putting each and every task to the resolved dictionary.

Step 5: Calling the dfs function for each task.
Step 6: Returning the resolved dictionary.
