# Research Project

A structured research project for academic work, experiments, and publications.

## Project Structure

```
├── experiments/       # Experiment configurations and results
├── notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
├── src/              # Reusable research code
├── paper/            # LaTeX/Markdown manuscript
├── references/       # Related papers and resources
├── data/             # Research datasets
└── results/          # Figures, tables, outputs
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Document your experiments in `experiments/`
3. Develop analysis in `notebooks/`
4. Write reusable code in `src/`
5. Draft your paper in `paper/`

## Best Practices

- Version control everything
- Document experiments thoroughly
- Make research reproducible
- Cite all sources in `references/`
