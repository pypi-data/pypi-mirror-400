    Compute the variance in (log-)expression values for each gene, and model the trend in the variances with respect to the mean.

    Args:
        x:
            A matrix-like object where rows correspond to genes or genomic features and columns correspond to cells.
            It is typically expected to contain log-expression values, e.g., from :py:func:`~scranpy.normalize_counts`.

        block:
            Array of length equal to the number of columns of ``x``, containing the block of origin (e.g., batch, sample) for each cell.
            Alternatively ``None``, if all cells are from the same block.

        block_average_policy:
            Policy for averaging statistics across blocks.
            This can either use a (weighted) ``mean`` or a ``quantile``.

        block_weight_policy:
            Policy for weighting different blocks when computing the weighted mean across blocks for each statistic.
            Only used if ``block`` is provided and ``block_average_policy = "mean"``.

        variable_block_weight:
            Parameters for variable block weighting.
            This should be a tuple of length 2 where the first and second values are used as the lower and upper bounds, respectively, for the variable weight calculation.
            Only used if ``block`` is provided, ``block_average_policy = "mean"``, and ``block_weight_policy = "variable"``.

        block_quantile:
            Probability for computing the quantile across blocks.
            Defaults to 0.5, i.e., the median of per-block statistics.
            Only used if ``block`` is provided and ``block_average_policy = "quantile"``.

        mean_filter:
            Whether to filter on the means before trend fitting.

        min_mean:
            The minimum mean of genes to use in trend fitting.
            Only used if ``mean_filter = True``.

        transform:
            Whether a quarter-root transformation should be applied before trend fitting.

        span:
            Span of the LOWESS smoother for trend fitting, see :py:func:`~scranpy.fit_variance_trend`.

        use_min_width:
            Whether a minimum width constraint should be applied during trend fitting, see :py:func:`~scranpy.fit_variance_trend`.

        min_width:
            Minimum width of the smoothing window for trend fitting, see :py:func:`~scranpy.fit_variance_trend`.

        min_window_count:
            Minimum number of observations in each smoothing window for trend fitting, see :py:func:`~scranpy.fit_variance_trend`.

        num_threads:
            Number of threads to use.

    Returns:
        A :py:class:`~biocutils.NamedList.NamedList` containing ``statistics``.
        This is a :py:class:`~biocframe.BiocFrame.BiocFrame` with one row per gene and the following columns:

        - ``mean``: a double-precision NumPy array containing the mean (log-)expression for each gene.
        - ``variance``: a double-precision NumPy array containing the mean (log-)expression for each gene.
        - ``fitted``: a double-precision NumPy array containing the fitted value of the mean-variance trend for each gene.
        - ``residual``: a double-precision NumPy array containing the residual from the mean-variance trend for each gene.

        If ``block`` is supplied, the ``NamedList`` will also contain:

        - ``per_block``: a :py:class:`~biocutils.NamedList.NamedList` containing the per-block statistics.
          Each entry is a ``BiocFrame`` that contains the ``mean``, ``variance``, ``fitted`` and ``residual`` for each block.
        - ``block_ids``: a list containing the identities of the blocks.
          This corresponds to the entries of ``per_block``.
