    """
    Result of submitting an Agent Definition to Platform Core.

    This immutable entity represents the outcome of an agent submission,
    including review status, tracking information, and feedback from
    Platform Core's review and governance process.

    Per Platform Constitution (rule-docs/Platform Vision & System Boundary.md):
    - SDK can submit but NOT approve agents
    - Platform Core has final authority over acceptance
    - Submission does NOT create an Execution
    - Submission does NOT incur billing (unless platform policy states)

    Attributes:
        review_id: Unique identifier for tracking this submission through
            the review process. Use with track_submission() to check status.
        status: Current status of the submission (pending_review, accepted,
            rejected, draft).
        submitted_at: ISO 8601 timestamp when the submission was received
            by Platform Core. Example: "2025-12-30T10:00:00Z"
        agent_id: Unique agent identifier assigned by Platform Core.
            Only present if status is ACCEPTED. Use this ID to reference
            the agent in execution requests.
        agent_version_id: Unique identifier for this specific version of
            the agent. Only present if status is ACCEPTED.
        tracking_url: URL to the Developer Console page where developers
            can track review progress and see detailed feedback.
        marketplace_url: URL to the marketplace listing for this agent.
            Only present if status is ACCEPTED.
        feedback: Tuple of ReviewFeedback items from Platform Core's
            review process. Empty if no feedback provided yet.
        estimated_review_time: Human-readable estimate of review completion
            time. Examples: "24h", "2-3 business days", "pending manual review".
            None if no estimate available.

    Example:
        >>> result = SubmissionResult(
        ...     review_id="review_abc123",

        Check if submission was accepted by Platform Core.

        A submission is considered "accepted" if it was either:
        1. Accepted for review (PENDING_REVIEW) - awaiting final decision
        2. Approved and live (ACCEPTED) - agent is in marketplace

        Note: This does NOT mean the agent is live yet if status is
        PENDING_REVIEW. Use is_live to check if agent is in marketplace.
