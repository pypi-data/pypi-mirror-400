# mydocuments

A command line tool that returns the path to the user's `Documents` directory.

## Description

Conventional knowledge says that in Windows, user's default Documents directory
is located in `%USERPROFILE%\Documents`. 

This is **wrong**.

The `Documents` directory can exist in multiple locations:

```batch
    %USERPROFILE%\Documents
    %USERPROFILE%\OneDrive\Documents
    %USERPROFILE%\OneDrive - [Company Name]\Documents
```

In fact, a folder named `Documents` can exist in all of the above locations
simultaneously.

They all may have files inside. Which one is the correct one?

That is for windows to know, and for you to find out.

Except, it's not that easy.

You see, there is no environmental variable that tells you which one is the 
correct one.

There is no environment variable that tells you whether OneDrive backup is
enabled or not, or if it is, if it's personal OneDrive or OneDrive for Business.

This tool was written to eliminate the guess-work and provide a definite answer
by making a Windows API call to retrieve the correct path.

For platform agnosticism sake, it also provides a fuzzy find method that
attempts to guess a path to a folder named `Documents` by process of elimination.

That part of the program is somewhat error prone. The Windows API method on the
other hand, will yield the correct result every time.

## Usage

```bash
    mydocuments [-f | -w | -h | -v]

      --help,    -h    Show this help message and exit.
      --version, -v Show version information and exit.
      --fuzzy,   -f   Use a fuzzy multiplatform method.
      --winapi,  -w  Use Windows API method.
```

By default, if run on Windows the tool will use the accurate `-w` method.
On other platforms it will default to the fuzzy finder, for obvious reasons.

## Installation

### Any Platform

You can install using `uv` (see [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)):

    uv tool install mydocuments

You can also run it without installing:

    uv tool run mydocuments

### Windows

On Windows, this tool is distributed via `scoop` 
(see [scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh)).

 First, you need to add my bucket:

    scoop bucket add maciak https://github.com/maciakl/bucket
    scoop update

 Next simply run:
 
    scoop install mydocuments

If you don't want to use `scoop` you can simply download the executable from 
the release page and extract it somewhere in your path.
