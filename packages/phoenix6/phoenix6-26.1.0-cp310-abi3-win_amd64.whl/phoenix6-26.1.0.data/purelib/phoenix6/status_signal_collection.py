        """
        Waits for new data on all signals up to timeout.
        This API is typically used with CANivore Bus signals as they will be synced using the
        CANivore Timesync feature and arrive simultaneously. Signals on a roboRIO bus cannot
        be synced and may require a significantly longer blocking call to receive all signals.

        Note that CANivore Timesync requires Phoenix Pro.

        This can also be used with a timeout of zero to refresh many signals at once, which
        is faster than calling refresh() on every signal. This is equivalent to calling self.refresh_all.

        If a signal arrives multiple times while waiting, such as when *not* using CANivore
        Timesync, the newest signal data is fetched. Additionally, if this function times out,
        the newest signal data is fetched for all signals (when possible). We recommend checking
        the individual status codes using self.status when this happens.

        :param timeout_seconds: Maximum time to wait for new data in seconds.
                                Pass zero to refresh all signals without blocking.
        :type timeout_seconds: second
        :returns:   An InvalidParamValue if this signal collection is empty,
                    InvalidNetwork if signals are on different CAN bus networks,
                    RxTimeout if it took longer than timeoutSeconds to receive all the signals,
                    MultiSignalNotSupported if using the roboRIO bus with more than one signal and a non-zero timeout.
                    An OK status code means that all signals arrived within timeoutSeconds and they are all OK.

                    Any other value represents the StatusCode of the first failed signal.
                    Check the status of each signal to determine which ones failed.

        A frequency of 0 Hz will turn off the signal. Otherwise, the minimum supported signal

        the fastest requested update frequency will be applied to the frame.
