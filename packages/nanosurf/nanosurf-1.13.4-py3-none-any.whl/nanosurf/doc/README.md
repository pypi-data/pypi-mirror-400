# Nanosurf Python library and application package

The Nanosurf Python package contains classes and functions for the following topics:

* Remote control of Nanosurf Studio and classic Nanosurf Atomic-Force-Microscopes
* A large number of general functions for data analysis
* Application Framework to create powerful graphical applications based on QT
* MacOS and Linux platform can use the library for off-line analysis
* Multiple demo applications

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 up to 3.13 installed on Windows OS/Mac or any other supported operating system. Get the installation from 'python.org'
* Nanosurf Studio or any classic Nanosurf controller software with 'Scripting Interface' option activated

## Installation and upgrading

To install the package, open a Windows Command Prompt and run:

```shell
pip install nanosurf
```

To upgrade your nanosurf package to the newest version,
open Windows Command Prompt and run:

```shell
pip install nanosurf -U
```

## Running the examples

In the library, Nanosurf provides a documentation, demo scripts, applications for some hardware addons and templates to give you a quick start.
They are in the nanosurf package sub folders "app" and "doc". But where are they on your system?

Depending on the exact installation of python, the package folders can be at very different places.
Open Windows Command Prompt and type:

```python
python 
>>> import nanosurf
>>> nanosurf.help()
```

The output of this command print the exact path to the app and doc folder.

We suggest to use Visual Studio Code as your IDE to run, write and debug your Python code.
Use one of path to open the example scripts

## AFM Software Programmers Manual

The classic Nanosurf AFM Control Software has a own programmers manual and can be found in the Scripting Manual
in Nanosurf controller software under Help tab:
Help -> Manuals -> Script Programmers Manual

Unfortunately the Nanosurf Studio application do not yet have its own programmers manual. But we are working hard to provide this.
