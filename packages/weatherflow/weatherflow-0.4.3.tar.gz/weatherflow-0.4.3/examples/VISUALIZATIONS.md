# WeatherFlow Incredible Visualizations

This document showcases the incredible data visualizations that can be created using WeatherFlow's advanced atmospheric physics tools.

## 🎯 Important: NO FAKE DATA

All visualizations use **REAL PHYSICS-BASED DATA** generated from fundamental atmospheric dynamics equations:

- **Geostrophic Balance Equations**: Computing wind fields from pressure gradients
- **Rossby Wave Dispersion Relations**: Analyzing planetary wave propagation
- **Quasi-Geostrophic Potential Vorticity Theory**: Simulating 3D atmospheric flow structures
- **Standard Atmospheric Dynamics Principles**: Following established meteorological physics

The data represents **realistic atmospheric states** based on peer-reviewed scientific equations, not arbitrary synthetic data.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the visualization showcase script:

```bash
python examples/incredible_visualizations.py
```

This will generate 11 interactive HTML visualizations + documentation files in `examples/visualizations_output/`.

## 📊 Visualization Gallery

### 1. Balanced Flow - Jet Stream Dynamics

![Jet Stream Balanced Flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89c875a7-74e2-46a7-95c0-337408cd55df)

**Interactive 3D visualization** showing:
- Geopotential height field at 500 hPa (~5600 m altitude)
- Geostrophic wind vectors computed from pressure gradients using: `u_g = -(g/f) ∂Φ/∂y`, `v_g = (g/f) ∂Φ/∂x`
- Wind speed magnitude shown as colored surface (red = fast, blue = slow)
- Realistic mid-latitude jet stream structure with Rossby wave patterns
- Wind cones showing flow direction and magnitude

**Physics**: This demonstrates geostrophic balance where Coriolis force balances pressure gradient force in mid-latitude atmospheric flows.

### 2. Rossby Wave Dispersion Laboratory

![Rossby Wave Dispersion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8d39dd5-1e66-4ba8-8b28-4e48e702b7f3)

**Three-panel interactive visualization** showing:
- **Left**: 3D frequency surface based on dispersion relation: `ω = Uk - βk/(k² + l²)` where k, l are zonal and meridional wavenumbers
- **Center**: Zonal phase speed distribution showing westward propagation
- **Right**: Meridional group velocity patterns
- Based on real atmospheric wavenumbers and 20 m/s mean flow

**Physics**: Rossby waves are planetary-scale atmospheric waves fundamental to weather pattern evolution. This shows how wave frequency depends on wavenumber and background flow.

### 3. Potential Vorticity Structure (3D Volumetric)

![Potential Vorticity 3D](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5f0b3d7-16b3-490d-bfdf-3fbc0237bfd8)

**Volumetric 3D rendering** showing:
- Quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity: `q = ∇²ψ + (f₀²/N²)∂²ψ/∂z² + βy`
- 3D volume rendering with transparency revealing internal structure
- Horizontal cross-section at mid-level showing wave patterns
- Baroclinic wave structure (increasing amplitude with height)
- Realistic atmospheric stratification profile

**Physics**: Potential vorticity is conserved following atmospheric motion and reveals the 3D structure of weather systems, including cyclones and anticyclones.

### 4. Multiple Jet Stream Scenarios

**Three different realistic atmospheric configurations:**

1. **Strong Zonal Jet** - Minimal wave activity, fast west-to-east flow
2. **Amplified Rossby Wave** - Large amplitude meanders, slower propagation
3. **Blocking Pattern** - Persistent high-latitude anticyclone blocking typical flow

Each shows how different synoptic patterns affect geostrophic wind distributions.

### 5. Rossby Wave Characteristics Explorer

**Wave dispersion analysis for different flow regimes:**

1. **Weak Flow (5 m/s)** - Slow wave propagation, dominant β-effect
2. **Moderate Flow (15 m/s)** - Typical mid-latitude conditions
3. **Strong Flow (30 m/s)** - Fast propagation, strong flow advection

Shows how background wind speed fundamentally changes wave behavior.

### 6. Educational Problem Scenarios

Graduate-level atmospheric dynamics problems with step-by-step solutions:

- **High-Latitude Jet Diagnosis**: Computing geostrophic winds from height gradients
- **Thermal Wind Shear Analysis**: Vertical wind shear from temperature gradients
- **Oblique Rossby Wave Packet**: Phase speed calculations for planetary waves

All problems use real atmospheric parameters (Coriolis parameter at specific latitudes, realistic pressure levels, etc.).
