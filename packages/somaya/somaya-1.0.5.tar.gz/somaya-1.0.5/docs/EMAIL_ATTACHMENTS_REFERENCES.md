## What Actually Exists

### 1. SOMA Technical Paper

**Primary Technical Paper** (Most Relevant):
- **File**: `docs/VOCABULARY_ADAPTER_TECHNICAL_PAPER.md`
- **Location**: `docs/VOCABULARY_ADAPTER_TECHNICAL_PAPER.md`
- **Content**: Complete technical analysis of vocabulary compatibility issue and adapter solution
- **Status**: ✅ Complete, based on actual implementation code
- **Length**: ~1000+ lines
- **Includes**: Mathematical proofs, algorithm documentation, implementation details, honest limitations

**Alternative Papers** (Also Available):
- `docs/papers/PROFESSIONAL_IEEE_PAPER.md` - General SOMA paper
- `docs/papers/HONEST_IEEE_PAPER.md` - Honest assessment paper
- `SANTOK_ACADEMIC_PAPER.md` - Academic paper format
- `SANTOK_PROFESSIONAL_PAPER.md` - Professional paper format
- `SANTOK_PLAGIARISM_FREE_PAPER.md` - Plagiarism-free version

**Recommendation**: Use `docs/VOCABULARY_ADAPTER_TECHNICAL_PAPER.md` as it's the most relevant to the vocabulary compatibility work and is based entirely on actual code.
