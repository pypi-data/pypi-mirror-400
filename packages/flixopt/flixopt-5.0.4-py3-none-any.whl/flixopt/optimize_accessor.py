    Examples:
        Standard optimization (via __call__):

        >>> print(flow_system.solution)

        Rolling horizon optimization:

        Use this for simple optimization workflows. For more control (e.g., inspecting
        the model before solving, or adding custom constraints), use `build_model()`
        and `solve()` separately.

        Args:

        Solve the optimization using a rolling horizon approach.

        Divides the time horizon into overlapping segments that are solved sequentially.
        Each segment uses final values from the previous segment as initial conditions,
        ensuring dynamic continuity across the solution. The combined solution is stored
        on the original FlowSystem.

        This approach is useful for:
        - Large-scale problems that exceed memory limits
        - Annual planning with seasonal variations
        - Operational planning with limited foresight

        Args:
            solver: The solver to use (e.g., HighsSolver, GurobiSolver).
            horizon: Number of timesteps in each segment (excluding overlap).
                Must be > 2. Larger values provide better optimization at the cost
                of memory and computation time. Default: 100.
            overlap: Number of additional timesteps added to each segment for lookahead.
                Improves storage optimization by providing foresight. Higher values
                improve solution quality but increase computational cost. Default: 0.
            nr_of_previous_values: Number of previous timestep values to transfer between
                segments for initialization (e.g., for uptime/downtime tracking). Default: 1.

        Returns:
            List of segment FlowSystems, each with their individual solution.
            The combined solution (with overlaps trimmed) is stored on the original FlowSystem.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If horizon <= 2 or overlap < 0.
            ValueError: If horizon + overlap > total timesteps.
            ValueError: If InvestParameters are used (not supported in rolling horizon).

        Examples:
            Basic rolling horizon optimization:

            >>> segments = flow_system.optimize.rolling_horizon(
            ...     solver,
            ...     horizon=168,  # Weekly segments
            ...     overlap=24,  # 1-day lookahead
            ... )
            >>> print(flow_system.solution)  # Combined result

            Inspect individual segments:

            >>> for i, seg in enumerate(segments):
            ...     print(f'Segment {i}: {seg.solution["costs"].item():.2f}')

        Note:
            - InvestParameters are not supported as investment decisions require
              full-horizon optimization.
            - Global constraints (flow_hours_max, etc.) may produce suboptimal results
              as they cannot be enforced globally across segments.
            - Storage optimization may be suboptimal compared to full-horizon solutions
              due to limited foresight in each segment.
