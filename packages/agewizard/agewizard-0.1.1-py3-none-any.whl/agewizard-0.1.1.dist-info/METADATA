## 🛠 Installation

```bash
pip install agewizard
```

## 📖 Detailed Usage

### 1. Interactive User Input (The Easiest Way)
Agewizard is built for real-world apps where users provide input.

```python
from agewizard import Age

# Get input from user
user_dob = input("Enter your Date of Birth (YYYY-MM-DD): ")

try:
    person = Age(user_dob)
    print(f"Wizard says you are {person.years} years old!")
    print(f"Your star sign is {person.zodiac}.")
    print(f"Days until your next cake: {person.next_birthday_days}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### 2. The Comprehensive `Age` Object
One object, all the data.

```python
from agewizard import Age

p = Age("1995-05-15")

print(p.years)           # 30
print(p.months)          # 368
print(p.days)            # 11210
print(p.readable)        # "30 years, 7 months, 24 days"
print(p.category)        # "Adult"
print(p.is_today)        # True if it's their birthday!
```

### 3. Comparing Two People
Perfect for social apps or family statistics.

```python
from agewizard import compare_ages

result = compare_ages("1990-01-01", "1995-05-15")
print(result) # "Person 1 is older by approx 5 years (1960 days)."
```

### 4. Specialized Logic
```python
from agewizard import is_leap_year, next_birthday_weekday

print(is_leap_year("2000-01-01")) # True
print(next_birthday_weekday("2000-01-01")) # "Thursday"
```

## 💎 Why Agewizard?

Most libraries require complex `datetime` arithmetic. Agewizard wraps all that complexity into a **Fluent API** that reads like a story. It's built for developers who value their time and want clean, production-ready code.
