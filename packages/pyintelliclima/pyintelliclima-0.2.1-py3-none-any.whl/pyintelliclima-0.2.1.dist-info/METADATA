This is a python module for communicating with the IntelliClima ECOCOMFORT 2.0 devices. 
Its main use is for my corresponding WIP HomeAssistant integration which I hope to release soon.

It can be extended to include other devices from IntelliClima in the future, but I only own the 
ECOCOMFORT, so I cannot add any others. Feel free to submit a PR for additional devices.

This API was made by reverse engineering the cloud API, through the use of an android emulator and proxy to catch the Intelliclima+ app traffic. As such, no public API exists and the functionality of this module breaks if the API changes.

## Credits

This was highly inspired by: https://github.com/ruizmarc/homebridge-intelliclima

Partial credit for the reverse engineering process of the API goes to them.
