# Blueprint Session 010 — COMPLETE

## Session Focus: User Experience Audit

### Executive Summary

**Audited first-time user journey.** Identified two blockers: (1) `[llm]` extras require reinstall, (2) hard-coded to Anthropic only. Tier 5 (provider abstraction) queued for next session.

---

## User Journey Audit Results

### What Works ✅

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| `pip install blueprint-ai` | ✅ Installs cleanly |
| `blueprint --help` | ✅ CLI works |
| Error messages | ✅ Clear and actionable |
| Documentation | ✅ Explains scope well |

### What's Broken 🔴

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| `anthropic` in `[llm]` extras | User must reinstall after first failure | Move to base deps (short term) |
| Hard-coded to Anthropic | OpenAI-only users blocked | Tier 5 provider abstraction |

## Current User Experience

```bash
# Step 1: Install
pip install blueprint-ai

# Step 2: Try to generate (FAILS)
blueprint generate "Build an API"
# Error: "Install with pip install blueprint[llm]"

# Step 3: Reinstall with extras (friction)
pip install blueprint-ai[llm]

# Step 4: Try again (FAILS if no Anthropic key)
blueprint generate "Build an API"
# Error: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not provided"

# Step 5: Only works with Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
blueprint generate "Build an API"  # Finally works
```

**Users without Anthropic API access cannot use Blueprint at all.**

---

## Target User Experience (Post Tier 5)

```bash
# One install
pip install blueprint-ai[anthropic]  # or [openai] or [all]

# Set any supported provider
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."  # OR
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."         # OR
export OUTPOST_API_KEY="op-..."        # Future

# Just works
blueprint generate "Build an API"
```
