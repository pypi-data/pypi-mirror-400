# Mapidy

Mapidy is an open-source toolkit for quickly deploying projects from a predefined architectural starting point.  
On the long-term horizon: batteries-included scaffolding (DB + API) for fast but constrained app development,  
with a strong focus on asset and metadata management, modification, and evolution.

This is currently a placeholder package published only to reserve the PyPI name whilst we are working on it.
