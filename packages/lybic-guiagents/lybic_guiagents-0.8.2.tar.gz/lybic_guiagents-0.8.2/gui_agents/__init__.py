"""
GUI Agents - A comprehensive GUI automation framework

This package provides both low-level agent components and a high-level service interface
for GUI automation tasks across different platforms and backends.

Main Components:
- AgentService: High-level service interface (recommended for most users)
- AgentS2, AgentSFast: Core agent implementations  
- HardwareInterface: Hardware abstraction layer
- ServiceConfig: Configuration management

Quick Start:
    from gui_agents import AgentService
    
    service = AgentService()
    result = service.execute_task("Take a screenshot")
    print(f"Task completed: {result.status}")
