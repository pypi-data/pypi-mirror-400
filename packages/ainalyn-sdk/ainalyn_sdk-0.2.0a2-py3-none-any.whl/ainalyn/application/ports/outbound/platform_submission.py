            Defaults to False.

    """
    Protocol for Platform Core API client.

    This outbound port (secondary port in hexagonal architecture)
    defines the interface for communicating with Platform Core API.

    Implementations handle:
    - HTTP communication details
    - Authentication (API key management)
    - Request/response serialization
    - Error handling and retries
    - Timeout management

    Per SOLID Principles:
    - Interface Segregation: Focused on submission operations only
    - Dependency Inversion: Application depends on this abstraction,
      not concrete HTTP implementations

    Per Clean Architecture:
    - This is an outbound port in the application layer
    - Domain and application layers depend on this protocol
    - Infrastructure layer provides concrete implementations
    - Enables testing with mocks

    Example Implementation:
        >>> class HttpPlatformClient:
        ...     def submit_agent(self, definition, api_key, options):
        ...         # HTTP POST to Platform Core API
        ...         response = requests.post(...)
        ...         return SubmissionResult(...)

        Submit an Agent Definition to Platform Core.

        This method sends the agent definition to Platform Core API
        for review and governance processing.

        Per Platform Constitution:
        - SDK can submit but NOT approve
        - Platform Core has final authority
        - Submission does NOT create an Execution
        - Submission does NOT incur billing (unless policy states)

        Args:
            definition: The AgentDefinition to submit.
            api_key: Developer API key for authentication.
            options: Optional submission configuration.

        Returns:
            SubmissionResult: Result containing review_id, status,
                and tracking information.

        Raises:
            AuthenticationError: If api_key is invalid or expired.
            NetworkError: If network communication fails.
            SubmissionError: If submission fails for other reasons
                (validation, quota, policy violations).
