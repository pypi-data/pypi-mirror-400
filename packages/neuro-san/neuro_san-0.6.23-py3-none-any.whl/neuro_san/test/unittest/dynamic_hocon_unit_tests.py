    Assists in putting together dynamic test cases from a list of hocon files
    that describe individual test cases digestible by DataDrivenAgentTestDriver.

    Usually a single instance is created as a constant within a TestCase class and
    the parameterized.expand() annotation is used to dynamically create individual
    test methods from list of hocon files provided to it. Since the hocon files themselves
    completelt define the test cases, their names are expected to confer information as to
    just what they are testing.

    Instance methods here help run the TestCase methods.
    The main entry point here is one_test_hocon().

    Static methods are used in leveraging the paramaterized.expand annotation
    for parameterizing unit tests. The main entry point for that is from_hocon_list().

    See test_hocons.py for an example for how to use this effectively.
