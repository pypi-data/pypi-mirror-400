The respective data sheets are stored in the DEALA directory. Additionally, it must be specified whether to use nominal or real prices, and how future prices should be approximated—either by regression analysis or geometric average. Besides, you can decide if the prices should be regionalized. In this example, this is based on the Purchasing power parities (PPP) for the year 2023 as stated by the OECD. \n",
