PynPoint is a generic, end-to-end pipeline for the reduction and analysis of high-contrast imaging data of exoplanets. The pipeline uses principal component analysis (PCA) for the subtraction of the stellar PSF and supports post-processing with ADI, RDI, and SDI techniques. The package is stable, extensively tested, and actively maintained.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available at `http://pynpoint.readthedocs.io <http://pynpoint.readthedocs.io>`_, including installation instructions, details on the pipeline architecture, and several notebook tutorials.

Attribution
-----------

If you use PynPoint in your publication then please cite `Stolker et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...621A..59S/abstract>`_. Please also cite `Amara & Quanz (2012) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.427..948A/abstract>`_ as the origin of PynPoint, which focused initially on the use of PCA as a PSF subtraction method. In case you use specifically the PCA-based background subtraction module or the wavelet based speckle suppression module, please give credit to `Hunziker et al. (2018) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...611A..23H/abstract>`_ or `Bonse et al. (preprint) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180405063B/abstract>`_, respectively.

Contributing
------------

Contributions in the form of bug fixes, new or improved functionalities, and pipeline modules are highly appreciated. Please consider forking the repository and creating a pull request to help improve and extend the package. Instructions for `coding of a pipeline module <https://pynpoint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coding.html>`_ are available in the documentation. Bugs can be reported by creating an `issue <https://github.com/PynPoint/PynPoint/issues>`_ on the Github page.
