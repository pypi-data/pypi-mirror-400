"""
Advective Transport Modeling for 1D Aquifer Systems.

This module provides functions to model compound transport by advection in one-dimensional
aquifer systems, enabling prediction of solute or temperature concentrations in extracted
water based on infiltration data and aquifer properties. The model assumes one-dimensional
groundwater flow where water infiltrates with concentration ``cin``, flows through the aquifer
with pore volume distribution, compounds are transported with retarded velocity (retardation
factor >= 1.0), and water is extracted with concentration ``cout``.

Available functions:

- :func:`infiltration_to_extraction_series` - Single pore volume, time-shift only. Shifts
  infiltration time edges forward by residence time. Concentration values remain unchanged
  (cout = cin). No support for custom output time edges. Use case: Deterministic transport
  with single flow path.

- :func:`infiltration_to_extraction` - Arbitrary pore volume distribution, convolution.
  Supports explicit distribution of aquifer pore volumes with flow-weighted averaging.
  Flexible output time resolution via cout_tedges. Use case: Known pore volume distribution
  from streamline analysis.

- :func:`gamma_infiltration_to_extraction` - Gamma-distributed pore volumes, convolution.
  Models aquifer heterogeneity with 2-parameter gamma distribution. Parameterizable via
  (alpha, beta) or (mean, std). Discretizes gamma distribution into equal-probability bins.
  Use case: Heterogeneous aquifer with calibrated gamma parameters.

Note on dispersion: The spreading from the pore volume distribution (APVD) represents
macro-scale aquifer heterogeneity—this is the same physical phenomenon as "dispersion"
but at a larger observation scale. If APVD was calibrated from breakthrough curves, this
spreading already includes all dispersion effects at smaller scales. To add pore-scale
dispersion separately (when APVD comes from streamline analysis), use
:mod:`gwtransport.diffusion`. See :ref:`concept-dispersion-scales` for details.

- :func:`extraction_to_infiltration_series` - Single pore volume, time-shift only
  (deconvolution). Shifts extraction time edges backward by residence time. Concentration
  values remain unchanged (cin = cout). Symmetric inverse of infiltration_to_extraction_series.
  Use case: Backward tracing with single flow path.

- :func:`extraction_to_infiltration` - Arbitrary pore volume distribution, deconvolution.
  Inverts forward transport for arbitrary pore volume distributions. Symmetric inverse of
  infiltration_to_extraction. Flow-weighted averaging in reverse direction. Use case:
  Estimating infiltration history from extraction data.

- :func:`gamma_extraction_to_infiltration` - Gamma-distributed pore volumes, deconvolution.
  Inverts forward transport for gamma-distributed pore volumes. Symmetric inverse of
  gamma_infiltration_to_extraction. Use case: Calibrating infiltration conditions from
  extraction measurements.

- :func:`infiltration_to_extraction_front_tracking` - Exact front tracking with Freundlich sorption.
  Event-driven algorithm that solves 1D advective transport with Freundlich isotherm using
  analytical integration of shock and rarefaction waves. Machine-precision physics (no numerical
  dispersion). Returns bin-averaged concentrations. Use case: Sharp concentration fronts with
  exact mass balance required, single deterministic flow path.

- :func:`infiltration_to_extraction_front_tracking_detailed` - Front tracking with piecewise structure.
  Same as infiltration_to_extraction_front_tracking but also returns complete piecewise analytical
  structure including all events, segments, and callable analytical forms C(t). Use case: Detailed
  analysis of shock and rarefaction wave dynamics.

    Compute extraction time edges from infiltration time edges using residence time shifts.

    This function shifts infiltration time edges forward in time based on residence
    times computed from flow rates and aquifer properties. The concentration values remain
    unchanged (cout equals cin), only the time edges are shifted. This assumes a single pore
    volume (no distribution) and deterministic advective transport.

    support custom output time edges (cout_tedges). For distributions of aquifer pore volumes
    or custom output time grids, use `infiltration_to_extraction` instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    flow : array-like
        Flow rate values in the aquifer [m3/day].

    Compute the concentration of the extracted water using flow-weighted advection.

    This function implements an infiltration to extraction advection model where cin and flow values
    correspond to the same aligned time bins defined by tedges.

    The algorithm:
    1. Computes residence times for each pore volume at cout time edges
    2. Calculates infiltration time edges by subtracting residence times
    3. Determines temporal overlaps between infiltration and cin time windows
    4. Creates flow-weighted overlap matrices normalized by total weights
    5. Computes weighted contributions and averages across pore volumes


    Parameters
    ----------
    cin : array-like
        Concentration values of infiltrating water or temperature [concentration units].
        Length must match the number of time bins defined by tedges.
    flow : array-like
        Flow rate values in the aquifer [m3/day].
        Length must match cin and the number of time bins defined by tedges.
    tedges : pandas.DatetimeIndex
        Time edges defining bins for both cin and flow data. Has length of
        len(cin) + 1 and len(flow) + 1.
    cout_tedges : pandas.DatetimeIndex
        Time edges for output data bins. Has length of desired output + 1.
        Can have different time alignment and resolution than tedges.
    aquifer_pore_volumes : array-like
        Array of aquifer pore volumes [m3] representing the distribution
        of residence times in the aquifer system.
    retardation_factor : float, optional
        Retardation factor of the compound in the aquifer (default 1.0).
        Values > 1.0 indicate slower transport due to sorption/interaction.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Flow-weighted concentration in the extracted water. Same units as cin.
        Length equals len(cout_tedges) - 1. NaN values indicate time periods
        with no valid contributions from the infiltration data.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If tedges length doesn't match cin/flow arrays plus one, or if
        infiltration time edges become non-monotonic (invalid input conditions).

    Parameters
    ----------
    cin : array-like
        Infiltration concentration [mg/L or any units].
        Length = len(tedges) - 1.

        Length = len(tedges) - 1.
    tedges : pandas.DatetimeIndex
        Time bin edges. Length = len(cin) + 1.
    cout_tedges : pandas.DatetimeIndex
        Output time bin edges. Can be different from tedges.
        Length determines output array size.
    aquifer_pore_volumes : array-like
        Array of aquifer pore volumes [m³] representing the distribution
        of residence times in the aquifer system. Each pore volume must be positive.
    freundlich_k : float, optional
        Freundlich coefficient [(m³/kg)^(1/n)]. Must be positive.
        Used if retardation_factor is None.
    freundlich_n : float, optional
        Freundlich exponent [-]. Must be positive and != 1.
        Used if retardation_factor is None.
    bulk_density : float, optional
        Bulk density [kg/m³]. Must be positive.
        Used if retardation_factor is None.

        Porosity [-]. Must be in (0, 1).
        Used if retardation_factor is None.
    retardation_factor : float, optional
        Constant retardation factor [-]. If provided, uses linear retardation
        instead of Freundlich sorption. Must be >= 1.0.
    max_iterations : int, optional
        Maximum number of events. Default 10000.

    Returns
    -------
    cout : numpy.ndarray
        Bin-averaged extraction concentration averaged across all pore volumes.
        Length = len(cout_tedges) - 1.

    Notes
    -----
    **Spin-up Period**:
    The function computes the first arrival time t_first. Concentrations
    before t_first are affected by unknown initial conditions and should
    not be used for analysis. Use `infiltration_to_extraction_front_tracking_detailed`
    to access t_first.

    **Machine Precision**:
    All calculations use exact analytical formulas. Mass balance is conserved
    to floating-point precision (~1e-14 relative error). No numerical tolerances
    are used for time/position calculations.

    **Physical Correctness**:
    - All shocks satisfy Lax entropy condition
    - Rarefaction waves use self-similar solutions
    - Causality is strictly enforced

    Compute extracted concentration with complete diagnostic information.

    Returns both bin-averaged concentrations and detailed simulation structure for each pore volume.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cin : array-like
        Infiltration concentration [mg/L or any units].
        Length = len(tedges) - 1.
    flow : array-like
        Flow rate [m³/day]. Must be positive.
        Length = len(tedges) - 1.
    tedges : pandas.DatetimeIndex
        Time bin edges. Length = len(cin) + 1.
    cout_tedges : pandas.DatetimeIndex
        Output time bin edges. Can be different from tedges.
        Length determines output array size.
    aquifer_pore_volumes : array-like
        Array of aquifer pore volumes [m³] representing the distribution
        of residence times in the aquifer system. Each pore volume must be positive.
    freundlich_k : float, optional
        Freundlich coefficient [(m³/kg)^(1/n)]. Must be positive.
        Used if retardation_factor is None.
    freundlich_n : float, optional
        Freundlich exponent [-]. Must be positive and != 1.
        Used if retardation_factor is None.
    bulk_density : float, optional
        Bulk density [kg/m³]. Must be positive.
        Used if retardation_factor is None.
    porosity : float, optional
        Porosity [-]. Must be in (0, 1).
        Used if retardation_factor is None.
    retardation_factor : float, optional
        Constant retardation factor [-]. If provided, uses linear retardation
        instead of Freundlich sorption. Must be >= 1.0.
    max_iterations : int, optional
        Maximum number of events. Default 10000.

    Returns
    -------
    cout : numpy.ndarray
        Bin-averaged concentrations averaged across all pore volumes.

    structures : list of dict
        List of detailed simulation structures, one for each pore volume, with keys:

        - 'waves': List[Wave] - All wave objects created during simulation
        - 'events': List[dict] - All events with times, types, and details
        - 't_first_arrival': float - First arrival time (end of spin-up period)
