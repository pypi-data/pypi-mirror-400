    "===========\n",
    "\n",
    "This example covers the typical workflow for Gaussian beam mode matching. This usually consists of fitting the initial beam to measured data, setting up the mode matching problem in terms of the desired shifting ranges and lenses to use and finally evaluating the candidate solutions.\n",

    "Beam Characterization\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by characterizing the input beam. Let's assume that we have made a few beam diameter measurements at different z-coordinates along the beam. We can construct :class:`~corset.core.Beam` objects by fitting the measured data. Make sure to use the correct quantities and units. Beam corset describes Gaussian beams by their $1/e$ **radius** in amplitude which is equivalent to the $1/e^2$ radius in intensity, this is as opposed to many beam profilers which report the beam size as $1/e^2$ **diameter** in intensity. To preempt any kind of confusion, Beam corset uses meters for all units of length. We invoke the fit using the beam's :meth:`~corset.core.Beam.fit` class method.\n",

    "While in theory, all solutions which produce the same 100% mode overlap should be equivalent, in practice, they differ significantly in how easy they are to set up and adjust in the lab. There are a lot of things what play into how hard this is, but the two most important quantities (from the ones we can calculate here) are the sensitivity of the individual degrees of freedom and how strongly they are coupled.\n",

For the third solution this is $1.57\\text{ \\%/cm}^2$ and $0.22\\text{ \\%/cm}^2$ for the two lenses respectively. This means that if everything else is correct and we displace the first lens by $1\\text{ cm}$ (which we have to square to $1\\text{ cm}^2$), we lose about $1.57\\text{ \\%}$ mode overlap. For the other two solutions, the loss in overlap is much larger for such a displacement.\n",
