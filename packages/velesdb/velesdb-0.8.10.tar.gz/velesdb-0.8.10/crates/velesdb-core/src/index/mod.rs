/// Trait for vector index implementations.
///
/// All index implementations must be thread-safe (Send + Sync).
///
/// # Performance Note
///
/// For bulk insertions, prefer batch methods like [`HnswIndex::insert_batch_parallel`]
/// over calling [`Self::insert`] in a loop.
/// Individual inserts incur per-call lock overhead that batch methods avoid.
