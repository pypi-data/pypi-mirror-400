"""
Context managers for protected file access.

Provides guaranteed cleanup of decrypted sensitive files, ensuring
plaintext is never left on disk after an operation completes or fails.

Design principles:
- Use finally blocks for guaranteed cleanup
- Signal handlers for Ctrl+C protection (like bash `trap on_exit EXIT`)
- Atomic file operations (temp file + rename)
- State detection to handle mixed encrypted/plaintext files
- Graceful handling of plaintext keys (warn but use, then encrypt on exit)
- File locking to prevent race conditions with concurrent access
