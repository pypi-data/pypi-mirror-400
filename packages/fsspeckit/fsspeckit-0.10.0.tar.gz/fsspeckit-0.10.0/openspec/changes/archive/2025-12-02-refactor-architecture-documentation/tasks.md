## 1. Research and Analysis
- [x] 1.1 Analyze current implementation across all domain packages (core, storage_options, datasets, sql, common)
- [x] 1.2 Document actual component relationships and integration patterns
- [x] 1.3 Identify key architectural decisions that need documentation as ADRs
- [x] 1.4 Review existing examples to understand real-world usage patterns

## 2. Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- [x] 2.1 Write ADR-001: Domain Package Architecture (why this structure over alternatives)
- [x] 2.2 Write ADR-002: Backend-Neutral Planning Layer (centralized vs. decentralized approach)
- [x] 2.3 Write ADR-003: Façade Pattern for Backwards Compatibility (migration strategy)
- [x] 2.4 Write ADR-004: Multi-Cloud Abstraction Strategy (provider-agnostic design)
- [x] 2.5 Write ADR-005: Caching and Performance Architecture (design trade-offs)

## 3. Core Architecture Documentation
