    Follow the differential motor output of another Talon while ignoring the
    leader's invert setting.
    
    If Talon is in torque control, the differential torque is copied - which will
    increase the total torque applied. If Talon is in duty cycle output control, the
    differential duty cycle is matched. If Talon is in voltage output control, the
    differential motor voltage is matched. Motor direction is strictly determined by
    the configured invert and not the leader. If you want motor direction to match
    or oppose the leader, use DifferentialFollower instead.
    
    The leader must enable its DifferentialOutput status signal. The update rate of
    the status signal determines the update rate of the follower's output and should
    be no slower than 20 Hz.
