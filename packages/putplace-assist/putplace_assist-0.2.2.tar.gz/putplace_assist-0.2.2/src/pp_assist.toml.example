# PutPlace Assist Configuration Example
#
# Copy this file to one of these locations:
#   - ./pp_assist.toml (current directory)
#   - ~/.config/putplace/pp_assist.toml (user config - recommended)
#   - /etc/putplace/pp_assist.toml (system config)
#
# Or set PPASSIST_CONFIG environment variable to point to your config file.
#
# You can also override any setting with environment variables using PPASSIST_ prefix:
#   PPASSIST_SERVER_PORT=9000 pp_assist start
#
# See packages/putplace-assist/src/putplace_assist/config.py for all options

[server]
# Host to bind the web server to

# Logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

# This server will be automatically configured in the database on first startup
# Name is derived from URL (e.g., "localhost:8100"), but you can customize it

url = "http://localhost:8100"

# Optional authentication credentials
# Uncomment and configure if your PutPlace server requires authentication
# username = "your-username"
# password = "your-password"

[database]
# SQLite database path for storing file metadata and activity logs
path = "~/.local/share/putplace/assist.db"

[watcher]
# Enable automatic file watching for registered paths

# This prevents rapid-fire events from overwhelming the system

[uploader]
# Number of parallel upload workers

# Number of retry attempts for failed uploads

# Delay between retries in seconds

# Timeout for each file upload in seconds (default: 600 = 10 minutes)
# Increase this for very large files or slow network connections

[sha256]
# Chunk size for reading files during SHA256 calculation (bytes)
# Larger chunks = faster processing but more memory usage

# Set to 0 for maximum speed (may impact system responsiveness)

# Number of files to process in each batch before pausing

# Delay between processing batches in seconds
# Gives the system time to handle other tasks
