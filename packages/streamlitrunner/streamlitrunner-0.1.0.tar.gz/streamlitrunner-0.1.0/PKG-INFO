# Streamlit Runner

![](./docs/streamlitrunner.png)

A simple way to run Streamlit app as a desktop app

## Installation

```shell
pip install streamlitrunner
```

## Usage

Import `streamlitrunner` and call `run()`

```python
# my_app.py
import streamlitrunner as sr
import streamlit as st

def main():
    st.title("Hello World!")
    st.write("This is a simple text example.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sr.run()
    main()
```

Now you can only call `python my_app.py` and it will work as a desktop app!

**Note:**  
To prevent `streamlit` warnings, call `run()` before any `st` call, as above.
