# Out-of-core data loading

## Context

This is an example of a Tesseract that loads in data from a folder by mounting the folder in the cli.

## Example Tesseract (`examples/dataloader`)

In the actual Tesseract, we may have logic that's expecting data samples for the input schema:

```{literalinclude} ../../../../examples/dataloader/tesseract_api.py
:pyobject: InputSchema
:language: python
```

The inputted data may be processed as such in an apply function:

```{literalinclude} ../../../../examples/dataloader/tesseract_api.py
:pyobject: apply
:language: python
```

You can then pass in data into this Tesseract by mounting the directory where the data samples are stored using the tesseract flag `--volume`:

```{literalinclude} ../../../../examples/dataloader/test-tesseract.sh
:lines: 10-12
:language: bash
```
