  "response_body": "To calibrate your spaceship's thrusters, you'll need to follow the standard calibration process. This typically involves powering down the thrusters, accessing the calibration controls, and running the diagnostic sequence to ensure all thruster outputs are balanced. Adjust the output levels as needed based on the diagnostic feedback, then save the new settings and power the thrusters back up. If you have any specific calibration tools or system interfaces, use those according to your ship's manual."
