# Blueprint Session 009 — COMPLETE

## Session Focus: Scope Clarification + Documentation Alignment

### Executive Summary

**Blueprint's identity crystallized.** All documentation now reflects the singular mission: generate the perfect blueprint. Execution is explicitly out of scope. Provider abstraction designed and added to roadmap as Tier 5.

---

## The North Star (Codified)

> **The perfect blueprint. Nothing more. Nothing less.**
>
> So detailed that agents don't ask questions.
> So structured that parsers don't guess.
> So complete that execution is mechanical.
>
> We are not in the business of building houses.
> We are in the business of drawing flawless plans.
