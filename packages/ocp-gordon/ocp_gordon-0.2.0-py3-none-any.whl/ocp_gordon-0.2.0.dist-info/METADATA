# Gordon Surface Library for CadQuery's OCP

This library provides a Python implementation for creating Gordon surfaces, a method for interpolating a network of curves to generate a smooth surface. It is designed to be compatible with CadQuery's OCP and leverages B-spline mathematics.

The implementation is written entirely in Python and is adapted from the original C++ code in [`occ_gordon`](https://github.com/rainman110/occ_gordon)

It is currently used by [`build123d`](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d), but can also be used independently.

## Features

- Gordon surface interpolation from profile and guide curves.
- Compatibility with B-spline representations.
- Integration with CadQuery's OCP (OpenCASCADE Python) for geometric primitives.

## Installation

This package can be installed using pip.

```bash
pip install ocp_gordon
```

## Dependencies

- OCP (OpenCASCADE Python)
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the library:

```python
# Assume you have profile_curves and guide_curves defined as lists of B-spline objects
# profile_curves = [...] # List of Geom_BSplineCurve objects
# guide_curves = [...]   # List of Geom_BSplineCurve objects

from ocp_gordon import interpolate_curve_network

gordon_surface = interpolate_curve_network(profile_curves, guide_curves, tolerance=3e-4)

```

For more detailed examples, please refer to the `examples/` directory in the source code.

## Test

To run tests, first install pytest, then:

```bash
python -m pytest

```

## Notable Difference from C++ Code

- In `intersect_bsplines.py`, the `math_BFGS` method is polyfilled and used in place of `math_FRPR`, as neither `math_BFGS` nor `math_FRPR` is usable in OCP due to the lack of `math_Vector` exposure. The intersect detection algorithm has been improved for both speed and reliability.
- In the `_solve()` function of `bspline_approx_interp.py`, regularization has been added to prevent singular matrix issues, which can occur in cases such as when the input curve is a B-spline derived from a circle.
- A new file, `misc.py`, has been introduced to implement missing OCP utilities. The primary additions include `clone_bspline` and `math_BFGS`.
- Modified `curve_network_sorter.py`, `bspline_algorithms.py`, and `interpolate_curve_network.py` to allow a single point to be used as either a profile or a guide.
- The reparameterization process is now skipped if the input profiles and guides are already iso-parametric, improving accuracy and performance for such cases.
- In `bspline_algorithms.py`, the `GeomConvert_ApproxCurve()` function is utilized for improved representation of conic curves.

## Caveats

Potential misalignments can occur between the generated Gordon surface and its input curves, especially at boundaries. This is primarily due to the approximation involved in the reparameterization process for non-iso-parametric inputs. For a detailed explanation and mitigation strategies, please refer to the [Gordon Surface Misalignment wiki page](https://github.com/gongfan99/ocp_gordon/wiki/Gordon-Surface-Misalignment).
