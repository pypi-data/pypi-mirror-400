# Testing for Long-Running Agents

This instruction file defines testing practices that prevent the "mark as done without proper testing" failure mode.

## Core Principle

**"If you haven't tested it as a user would, it's not verified."**

Unit tests are valuable but insufficient. Features must be verified end-to-end on the actual running system.

## Testing Pyramid for Agents

```
        /\
       /  \     E2E Tests (verify features.json)
      /----\
     /      \   Integration Tests
    /--------\
   /          \ Unit Tests
  /____________\
```

All layers matter, but **E2E tests are required for feature verification**.

## Before Marking a Feature Complete

### Required Steps

1. **Start the actual application**
   ```bash
   ./init.sh  # or platform-specific init
   ```

2. **Test each acceptance criterion**
   - Navigate/interact as a real user would
   - Use actual UI, CLI, or API endpoints
   - Not mocks, not simulations

3. **Document the test**
   - What you tested
   - How you tested it
   - What you observed
   - Any edge cases checked

4. **Only then update features.json**

## Testing Web Applications

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser and test:
# - Navigate between pages
# - Fill and submit forms
# - Click buttons, check results
# - Verify error states
# - Test on different viewports
```

### Automated E2E (Preferred)

```javascript
// Using Playwright or similar
test('user can add a todo', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="todo-input"]', 'Buy groceries');
  await page.press('[data-testid="todo-input"]', 'Enter');
  await expect(page.locator('.todo-item')).toContainText('Buy groceries');
});
```

## Testing APIs

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Test CRUD operations
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test todo"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/todos

curl http://localhost:3000/api/todos

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/todos/1

# Test error handling
curl http://localhost:3000/api/todos/nonexistent
# Should return 404, not 500
```

## Testing CLI Tools

```bash
# Help and version
./tool --help
./tool --version

# Normal operations
./tool create "Test item"
./tool list
./tool update 1 "Updated item"
./tool delete 1

# Error cases
./tool delete nonexistent  # Should show helpful error
./tool create ""           # Should validate input
```

## Red Flags (Don't Mark as Complete)

- ❌ Only ran unit tests
- ❌ Checked code looks correct
- ❌ Tested in isolation, not integrated
- ❌ Skipped testing because "it's a small change"
- ❌ Tested happy path only
- ❌ Server wasn't actually running

## Test Infrastructure

Every project should have:

1. **Quick smoke test** in init script
2. **Unit test suite** for logic
3. **Integration tests** for API/database
4. **E2E tests** for user flows (linked to features.json)

## Continuous Testing During Development

Don't batch testing to the end:

```
❌ Code, code, code, code → test everything at end

✅ Code → test → commit → code → test → commit
```

Test each change before moving on. This catches issues early when they're easy to fix.
