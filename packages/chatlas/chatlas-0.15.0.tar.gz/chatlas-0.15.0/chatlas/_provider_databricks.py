    Chat with a model hosted on Databricks.

    Databricks provides out-of-the-box access to a number of [foundation
    models](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/score-foundation-models.html)
    and can also serve as a gateway for external models hosted by a third party.

    Prerequisites
    --------------

    ::: {.callout-note}
    ## Python requirements

    `ChatDatabricks` requires the `databricks-sdk` package: `pip install
    "chatlas[databricks]"`.
    :::

    ::: {.callout-note}
    ## Authentication

    `chatlas` delegates to the `databricks-sdk` package for authentication with
    Databricks. As such, you can use any of the authentication methods discussed
    here:

    https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/sdk-python#authentication

    Note that Python-specific article points to this language-agnostic "unified"
    approach to authentication:

    https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/auth/unified-auth

    There, you'll find all the options listed, but a simple approach that
    generally works well is to set the following environment variables:

    * `DATABRICKS_HOST`: The Databricks host URL for either the Databricks
      workspace endpoint or the Databricks accounts endpoint.
    * `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`: The Databricks personal access token.
    :::

    Parameters
    ----------
    system_prompt
        A system prompt to set the behavior of the assistant.
    model
        The model to use for the chat. The default, None, will pick a reasonable
        default, and warn you about it. We strongly recommend explicitly
        choosing a model for all but the most casual use.
    workspace_client
        A `databricks.sdk.WorkspaceClient()` to use for the connection. If not
        provided, a new client will be created.

    Returns
    -------
    Chat
        A chat object that retains the state of the conversation.
