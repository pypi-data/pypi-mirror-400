# ai-homeless-man

A Python library designed to provide a simplified interface for accessing and utilizing core functionalities related to the ai-homeless-man concept. This package serves as a starting point for users interested in exploring this technology.

## Installation

You can install the `ai-homeless-man` package using pip:
bash
pip install ai-homeless-man

## Basic Usage Examples

Below are a few examples demonstrating how to use the `ai-homeless-man` library. Please note that these examples are simplified representations and may require further customization depending on your specific needs.

**Example 1: Generating a Basic Image Transformation**

This example shows how to apply a basic transformation to an image using the library.
python
from ai_homeless_man import core

image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
output_path = "path/to/output/image.jpg"

try:
    core.transform_image(image_path, output_path)
    print(f"Image transformed and saved to: {output_path}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: Image file not found at {image_path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

**Example 2: Creating a Text-Based Narrative**

This example illustrates how to generate a short narrative based on a provided prompt.
python
from ai_homeless_man import narrative

prompt = "A rainy day in a bustling city."
narrative_text = narrative.generate_story(prompt)

if narrative_text:
    print(narrative_text)
else:
    print("Failed to generate narrative.")

**Example 3: Performing a Simple Audio Modification**

This example demonstrates how to modify an audio file using the library's audio functionalities.
python
from ai_homeless_man import audio

input_audio = "path/to/your/audio.wav"
output_audio = "path/to/modified/audio.wav"

try:
    audio.modify_audio(input_audio, output_audio)
    print(f"Audio modified and saved to: {output_audio}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: Audio file not found at {input_audio}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

**Example 4: Detecting Faces in an Image**

This example shows how to detect faces within an image using the library's face detection capabilities.
python
from ai_homeless_man import vision

image_path = "path/to/your/image_with_faces.jpg"
faces = vision.detect_faces(image_path)

if faces:
    print(f"Found {len(faces)} faces in the image.")
    for face in faces:
        print(f"Face location: {face}") # Replace with more detailed info if available in 'face' object
else:
    print("No faces found in the image.")

## Feature List

*   **Image Transformation:** Basic image processing capabilities.
*   **Narrative Generation:** Text generation based on user prompts.
*   **Audio Modification:** Simple audio processing functionalities.
