A foundational Python library providing core components for building LLM-driven applications using an event-based agent
structure.

## 📦 Installation

This package is part of the `fabricatio` monorepo and is available as a single package using either pip or uv:

```bash
pip install fabricatio
# or
uv pip install fabricatio
```

For a full installation that includes this package and all other components of `fabricatio`:

```bash
pip install fabricatio[full]
# or
uv pip install fabricatio[full]
```

## 🔍 Overview

Provides essential tools for:

- Event-based architecture patterns
  The event-based architecture patterns in this library enable a reactive programming model. Events are used to trigger
  actions and communicate between different components of the application. For example, when a certain condition is met,
  an event can be emitted, and other parts of the application can listen for this event and respond accordingly. This
  pattern helps in building scalable and modular applications.
- Role-based agent execution framework
  The role-based agent execution framework allows for the definition of different roles for agents in the application.
  Each role has specific permissions and responsibilities, and agents can be assigned to these roles. For example, in a
  multi - user application, there could be roles like 'admin', 'user', and 'guest', each with different levels of access
  to resources and functionality.
- Task scheduling and management
  The task scheduling and management feature is responsible for organizing and executing tasks in the application. It
  can handle task dependencies, prioritize tasks, and ensure that tasks are executed in the correct order. For example,
  in a data processing application, tasks like data ingestion, transformation, and analysis can be scheduled and managed
  using this framework.
- File system operations and content detection
  This feature provides functionality for performing file system operations such as reading, writing, and deleting
  files. It also includes content detection capabilities, which can identify the type of content in a file, such as
  text, image, or binary data. For example, it can automatically detect the encoding of a text file or the format of an
  image file.
- Logging and diagnostics
  The logging and diagnostics feature helps in monitoring the application's behavior and troubleshooting issues. It can
  record important events, errors, and warnings in a log file, which can be used for debugging and auditing purposes.
  For example, if an error occurs during the execution of a task, the log can provide detailed information about the
  error, including the stack trace and the values of relevant variables.
- Template rendering and configuration handling
  The template rendering and configuration handling feature allows for the use of templates to generate dynamic content
  and manage application configuration. Templates can be used to generate HTML pages, emails, or other types of
  documents. Configuration handling ensures that the application can be easily configured with different settings, such
  as database connections and API keys.
- Type-safe data models for common entities
  The type-safe data models for common entities ensure that the data used in the application has a well - defined
  structure. These models are based on Pydantic, which provides type validation and serialization capabilities. For
  example, in a user management application, a data model can be defined for the 'User' entity, with attributes like '
  name', 'email', and 'password', and Pydantic can be used to validate the input data and ensure that it conforms to the
  defined model.
- Asynchronous execution utilities
  The asynchronous execution utilities enable the application to perform tasks asynchronously, which can improve the
  performance and responsiveness of the application. For example, in a web application, asynchronous I/O operations can
  be used to handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the main thread. This feature uses Python's
  asyncio library to implement asynchronous programming.

Built on a hybrid Rust/Python foundation for performance-critical operations.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Event System**: Reactive architecture with event emitters and listeners
  The event system is the core of the event - based architecture. Event emitters are responsible for generating events,
  and event listeners are registered to listen for specific events. When an event is emitted, all the registered
  listeners are notified, and they can perform their respective actions. For example, in a game application, an event
  emitter can be used to emit an event when a player scores a goal, and event listeners can be used to update the
  scoreboard and play a sound effect.
- **Role Framework**: Agent roles with workflow dispatching capabilities
  The role framework defines the different roles that agents can have in the application. Each role has a set of
  permissions and a workflow associated with it. When an agent is assigned a role, the workflow dispatching capabilities
  ensure that the agent follows the correct sequence of actions. For example, in a project management application, a '
  project manager' role may have a workflow that includes tasks like creating a project plan, assigning tasks to team
  members, and monitoring progress.
- **Task Engine**: Status-aware task management with dependencies
  The task engine is responsible for managing tasks in the application. It keeps track of the status of each task, such
  as 'pending', 'in progress', or 'completed'. It also handles task dependencies, ensuring that tasks are executed in
  the correct order. For example, in a software development project, a task to test a module may depend on the
  completion of the coding task for that module.
- **Toolbox System**: Callable tool registry with rich metadata
  The toolbox system maintains a registry of callable tools in the application. Each tool has rich metadata associated
  with it, such as its name, description, input parameters, and output format. This metadata can be used to discover and
  use tools in a more efficient way. For example, in a data analysis application, a tool for calculating statistical
  measures can be registered in the toolbox, and other parts of the application can use this tool by providing the
  appropriate input parameters.
- **Type Models**: Pydantic-based models for consistent data structures
  The type models are based on Pydantic, which provides a way to define and validate data structures. These models
  ensure that the data used in the application is consistent and conforms to the defined schema. For example, in a
  financial application, a type model can be used to define the structure of a transaction, including attributes like '
  amount', 'date', and 'description', and Pydantic can be used to validate the input data and ensure that it is in the
  correct format.
- **File Utilities**: Smart file operations with content type detection
  The file utilities provide a set of functions for performing file system operations. They include features like
  content type detection, which can automatically identify the type of content in a file. This can be useful for
  handling different types of files in a more intelligent way. For example, when reading a file, the file utilities can
  determine if it is a text file or a binary file and handle it accordingly.
- **Template Engine**: Handlebars-based template rendering system
  The template engine uses the Handlebars library to render templates. Templates are used to generate dynamic content by
  replacing placeholders with actual values. For example, in a web application, a template can be used to generate HTML
  pages with dynamic content like user names and product information. The Handlebars syntax allows for easy
  customization and reuse of templates.
- **Language Tools**: Language detection and text processing utilities
  The language tools provide capabilities for detecting the language of a text and performing text processing tasks.
  Language detection can be used to determine the language of a user - input text, which can be useful for providing
  language - specific services. Text processing utilities include functions for tasks like tokenization, stemming, and
  part - of - speech tagging, which can be used for natural language processing applications.
