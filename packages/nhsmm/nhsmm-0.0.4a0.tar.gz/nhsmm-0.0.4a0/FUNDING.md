# Funding & Support

This project is developed and maintained as **open-source research and infrastructure**.

If you find **NHSMM** useful in your work or research, you can support its continued development through the following channels:

## Funding Channels

- **GitHub Sponsors**  
  Supports direct development, maintenance, issue resolution, and core feature work.

- **Patreon**  
  Funds recurring, in-depth technical writing, research notes, and domain-specific deep dives  
  (Trading, IoT, Health), as well as early access to experimental ideas.

- **Medium**  
  Supports public-facing technical articles, educational content, and knowledge sharing.

## What Your Support Enables

Contributions help fund:

- Core library development and maintenance  
- Documentation, examples, and educational material  
- Research into advanced sequence modeling (HSMMs, neural extensions)  
- Cross-domain applications (finance, IoT, health)  
- Exploration of future-ready architectures, including accelerator- and quantum-driven approaches  

## Sustainability

Support from individuals and organizations ensures the **long-term sustainability** of open,  
reproducible, and domain-agnostic temporal modeling tools.

Thank you for supporting open research and open-source software.
