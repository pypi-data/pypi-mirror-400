# Contributing to MorningPy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MorningPy.

## Contributions Temporarily Paused

External code contributions will be opened in a couple of weeks.

This short pause allows us to:
- Define clear contribution rules
- Set up a clean and sustainable project structure
- Establish shared standards to develop responsibly together

Our goal is to provide contributors with clear guidance, strong foundations, and a healthy ecosystem before opening pull requests.

## What You Can Do Now

In the meantime, you are welcome to:

- Open issues with ideas or feedback
- Report bugs or documentation improvements
- Participate in discussions

Code submissions will be enabled once the contribution framework is ready.

Thank you for your patience — we look forward to building MorningPy together very soon.
