# Changelog

## [0.3.5] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- **Packaging / installability**: narrowed the default `abstractcore[...]` dependency set to avoid GPU-only stacks (notably vLLM) being installed on macOS, which could break `assistant --help` due to transitive `datasets/pyarrow` incompatibilities.

- **Session Clearing**: Clear session now also clears attached files
  - When user clicks "Clear" button, both messages and attached files are cleared
  - Updated confirmation dialog to mention attached files will be removed
  - Ensures complete session reset including file attachments
- **File Chip Styling**: Made file attachment chips more compact and space-efficient
  - Reduced font size from 10px to 8px for better space utilization

  - Window expansion reduced from +40px to +28px (30% space savings)
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed unwanted voice control panel extension
  - Eliminated the play/pause control panel that sometimes appeared at bottom
  - Cleaner interface without unnecessary UI extensions
  - Voice controls still available through existing TTS toggle button
- **File Attachment Persistence & Visual Indicators**: Enhanced file handling for better user experience
  - Files now remain attached after sending messages, allowing for easy reuse in follow-up messages
  - Added visual file attachment indicators (📎) in chat history dialog showing file count per message
  - Enhanced message history structure to track file attachments per message
  - Clear session now properly clears both messages and file attachment tracking
  - Improved file workflow: attach once, use multiple times until manually removed
