  status: draft
  title: Implement dynamic scheduling and dependency management
  additional_notes: |
    Build a timeline and Gantt‑style view for Tasc OS that automatically
    orders tasks based on their dependencies.  Support critical‑path
    analysis, milestone tracking and scenario planning so that project
    managers can adjust schedules when upstream tasks slip or scope
    changes.  Use existing Tasc dependencies to derive ordering and
    update schedules dynamically when status changes.
  testing_instructions: |
    1. Create several Tascs with dependency relationships (e.g., A
       depends on B and C).  Use the dynamic scheduler to generate a
       timeline and verify that tasks appear in the correct order.
    2. Change the status of an upstream task (e.g., mark B as delayed)
       and verify that the timeline updates accordingly.
    3. Confirm that milestone dates and critical paths are computed
       correctly.
  desired_outcome: |
    A scheduling engine that produces an up‑to‑date timeline for any
    project based on Tasc dependencies, with interactive views for
    milestones, critical paths and what‑if scenarios.

  status: draft
  title: Enable agent orchestration and multi‑agent pipelines
  additional_notes: |
    Extend the agent runtime to support sequencing and coordination of
    multiple agents for complex workflows.  Define a way to specify
    multi‑step pipelines (e.g., code generation → code review → testing
    → deployment) within Tasc definitions.  Agents should publish
    intermediate artifacts as buffers and pass them along to the next
    agent.  Provide tools for monitoring agent pipelines and
    intervening when needed.
  testing_instructions: |
    1. Create a pipeline definition in a Tasc and verify that agents
       execute the steps in order, passing outputs via AB buffers.

    Implement a Tasc type that requires a designated human to review
    and approve or reject deliverables before the Tasc progresses.  The
    system should support editing deliverables, providing feedback and
    branching execution depending on the decision.  Notifications and
    reminders should be sent to the approver until a decision is
    made.
  testing_instructions: |
    1. Assign a Tasc to a human approver and ensure that they are
       prompted to review the deliverable.
    2. Approve the task and verify that dependent tasks proceed; then
       reject the task and confirm that a revision Tasc is created.
    3. Check that reminders are sent at configured intervals until
       approval or rejection occurs.
  desired_outcome: |
    A smooth human‑in‑the‑loop process that ensures critical
    deliverables are reviewed by people without blocking automated
    tasks unnecessarily.
