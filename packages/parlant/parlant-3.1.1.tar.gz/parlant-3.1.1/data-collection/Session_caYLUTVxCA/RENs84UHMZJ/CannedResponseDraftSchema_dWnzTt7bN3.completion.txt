  "response_body": "To calibrate your spaceship's thrusters, you'll need to follow a step-by-step process to ensure optimal performance. First, make sure the ship is powered down and in a safe environment. Next, access the thruster control panel and run the diagnostic sequence to check for any errors. Once diagnostics are complete, adjust the thruster alignment settings according to the system's recommendations. Finally, power up the ship and perform a test firing to confirm everything is functioning correctly. Let me know if you need more detailed instructions on any of these steps."
