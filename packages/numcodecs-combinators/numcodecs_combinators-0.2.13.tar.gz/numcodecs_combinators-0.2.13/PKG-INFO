# numcodecs-combinators

Combinator codecs for the [`numcodecs`] buffer compression API.

The following combinators, implementing the `CodecCombinatorMixin` are provided:

- `CodecStack`: a stack of codecs
- `FramedCodecStack`: a stack of codecs that is framed with array data type and shape information
- `PickBestCodec`: pick the best codec to encode the data
