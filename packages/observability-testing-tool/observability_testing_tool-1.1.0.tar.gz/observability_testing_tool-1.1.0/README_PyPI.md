# 🏠 [Observability Testing Tool for Google Cloud](https://github.com/fmestrone/observability-testing-tool) 

Easily generate bulk logs and metrics in Google Cloud Operations Suite to test alerts, validate queries, and simulate real-world observability scenarios.  

## 🚀 Use Cases  

This Python-based tool is designed for:  

- ### **Training & Education**  

  Successfully used in the _Advanced Observability Querying in Google Cloud_ course, it helps create logs and metrics for hands-on labs and classroom demos.  

- ### **Testing & Validation**  

  Use it to:  

  - Simulate logs and metrics when testing expressions for Logs Explorer with **Logging Query Language** (LQL), for **Log Analytics** with SQL, and for Cloud Monitoring with **PromQL**.

  - Generate real-time live data to test Cloud Monitoring **alerts and notifications**. 

---

## ⚡ Generate Historical or Live Data  

The tool supports two data generation modes, that can be mixed within the same run.

- ### 📜 **Historical Logs & Metrics**  

  Bulk-generate logs and metrics for a past time window.  

  **Limits:**  
  
  - Google Cloud quotas apply: [Logging Limits](https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas#log-limits), [Monitoring Limits](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/custom-metrics/creating-metrics#writing-ts).
  
  - Logs: Up to **30 days in the past** and **1 day in the future**.  

  - Metrics: Up to **25 hours in the past** and **5 minutes in the future**.  

- ### ⏳ **Live Logs & Metrics**  

  Continuously generate logs and metrics between a **future start and end time**.

  The tool runs **until the specified end time**, creating data at the configured intervals.  

  **Ideal for testing alerts and notifications** in real-time.
