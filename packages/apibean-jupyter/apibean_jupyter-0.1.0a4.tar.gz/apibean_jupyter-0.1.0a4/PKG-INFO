# apibean-jupyter

**apibean-jupyter** is an infrastructure library for embedding and managing
a Jupyter Server as a reusable Python component.

Instead of treating Jupyter as a standalone application, apibean-jupyter
allows you to launch, configure, and control a Jupyter Server programmatically,
making it suitable for tools, GUIs, notebooks automation, and managed processes.

---

## Why apibean-jupyter?

Jupyter is often started as a CLI tool (`jupyter lab`, `jupyter server`),
which makes it difficult to:

- Embed Jupyter inside another application
- Manage its lifecycle from Python code
- Integrate it with process managers or dashboards
- Reuse the same configuration across tools

apibean-jupyter solves this by exposing Jupyter Server as a **first-class
Python object** with a clear lifecycle and extension points.

---

## Features

- Embed Jupyter Server via a simple Python API
- Optional CLI for quick launching
- Clean separation between core logic and UI/tooling
- Plugin hooks for customization (kernels, extensions, reporters)
- Designed for `uv run` workflows and managed environments
- No dependency on GUI frameworks

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install apibean-jupyter
```

Or run it directly with `uv`:

```bash
uv run --with apibean-jupyter apibean-jupyter --root notebooks
```

---

## Quick Start (Python API)

```python
from apibean_jupyter import JupyterServer

server = JupyterServer(
    root_dir="notebooks",
    ip="127.0.0.1",
)

print("Starting Jupyter at:", server.url)
server.start()
```

---

## Command Line Usage

```bash
apibean-jupyter --root notebooks
```

Show server information without starting:

```bash
apibean-jupyter --info
```

---

## Using with `uv run`

`apibean-jupyter` is designed to work well with `uv`:

```bash
uv run --with apibean-jupyter apibean-jupyter --root notebooks
```

It can also be embedded into other tools that depend on it.

---

## Extending via Plugins

apibean-jupyter provides a lightweight plugin system to hook into the server
lifecycle:

* Pre/post initialization
* Pre/post server start
* Shutdown handling

This allows you to implement features such as:

* Kernel mapping
* JupyterLab extension configuration
* Metrics and reporting
* Integration with process managers

---

## Relationship to the apibean ecosystem

apibean-jupyter is part of the **apibean ecosystem**, a collection of libraries
and tools focused on testability, automation, and developer tooling.

It is designed to be used alongside:

* **apibean-notebook** – notebook automation and analysis
* **apibean-client** – API and service interaction

---

## Design Philosophy

* Prefer composition over inheritance
* Keep CLI logic thin and reusable
* Avoid tight coupling with UI frameworks
* Make production behavior explicit and reproducible
