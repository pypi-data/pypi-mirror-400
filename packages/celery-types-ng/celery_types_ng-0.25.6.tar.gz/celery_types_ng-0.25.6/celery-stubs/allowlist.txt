# These are intentional deviations from runtime to provide better IDE support.
# Configuration kwargs are passed through **kwargs at runtime but we explicitly
# type them in the stub for autocomplete and type checking.

# Signals are None at class level but always set to Signal on instances in __init__
# We type them as Signal because that's what users will see on app instances
