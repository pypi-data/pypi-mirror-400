class ChassisSpeeds:
    """
    Represents the speed of a robot chassis. Although this struct contains
    similar members compared to a Twist2d, they do NOT represent the same thing.
    Whereas a Twist2d represents a change in pose w.r.t to the robot frame of
    reference, a ChassisSpeeds struct represents a robot's velocity.
    
    A strictly non-holonomic drivetrain, such as a differential drive, should
    never have a dy component because it can never move sideways. Holonomic
    drivetrains such as swerve and mecanum will often have all three components.

    Helper class that converts a chassis velocity (dx, dy, and dtheta components)
    into individual wheel speeds.
    
    The inverse kinematics (converting from a desired chassis velocity to
    individual wheel speeds) uses the relative locations of the wheels with
    respect to the center of rotation. The center of rotation for inverse
    kinematics is also variable. This means that you can set your set your center
    of rotation in a corner of the robot to perform special evasion maneuvers.
    
    Forward kinematics (converting an array of wheel speeds into the overall
    chassis motion) is performs the exact opposite of what inverse kinematics
    does. Since this is an overdetermined system (more equations than variables),
    we use a least-squares approximation.

    into individual module states (speed and angle).
    
    The inverse kinematics (converting from a desired chassis velocity to
    individual module states) uses the relative locations of the modules with
    respect to the center of rotation. The center of rotation for inverse
    kinematics is also variable. This means that you can set your set your center
    of rotation in a corner of the robot to perform special evasion maneuvers.
    
    Forward kinematics (converting an array of module states into the overall
    chassis motion) is performs the exact opposite of what inverse kinematics
    does. Since this is an overdetermined system (more equations than variables),
    we use a least-squares approximation.
    
    The inverse kinematics: [moduleStates] = [moduleLocations] * [chassisSpeeds]
    We take the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of [moduleLocations] and then
    multiply by [moduleStates] to get our chassis speeds.
    
    Forward kinematics is also used for odometry -- determining the position of
    the robot on the field using encoders and a gyro.
