# SDOM Input Data

This page describes all input data requirements for running SDOM optimizations.

## Input Data Structure

All input CSV files should be placed in a directory (e.g., `Data/scenario_name/`). The file names are defined in `constants.py` and are flexible (case-insensitive matching with spaces/hyphens/underscores ignored).

In the next sections each file will be listed and the data it is supossed to be in each field will be described

> **⚠️ Attention:**  
>  - Make sure all required CSV files are present in the specified folder before starting the simulation.
>  - Please keep the root names of each file. For instance, in the sample files you can change "2025" for whatever you prefer, but keeping the root name. For example, for "CapSolar_2025.csv" file you need to keep the root name as "CapSolar_".
>  - Please do not change the column names of each csv files.


## Required Files

### 1. Formulations Configuration

**File**: `formulations.csv`

This file the user selects the modeling approach (formulation) for each major system component in the SDOM optimization model. Each row assigns a formulation to a component, determining how SDOM will represent its behavior and constraints during optimization.

**CSV file columns:**
| Field/Column           | Description                                                                    |Expected type |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Component              | String with the component name you are going to set the formulation (Model).   |string        |
| Formulation            | Name of the formulation (model) you want to use. See more below.               |String        |
| Description (Optional) | Just a description/guidelines that developers let for users.                   |String        |

**Important Notes:**
- Only one formulation should be assigned per component.
- The chosen formulation directly affects how SDOM optimizes and simulates each component.
- Refer to the tables below for valid formulations for each component.

| Component | Formulation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| hydro | RunOfRiverFormulation | Fixed hourly hydro profile |
| hydro | MonthlyBudgetFormulation | Monthly energy budget constraint |
| hydro | DailyBudgetFormulation | Daily energy budget constraint |

#### Large Hydropower
###### **File**: `lahy_hourly.csv`
This file provides the hourly generation time-series for hydropower plants. The way SDOM utilizes this data depends on the selected hydro formulation ([see section 2.1 formulations.csv](#21-formulationscsv)):

- **RunOfRiverFormulation:**  
    Hydropower generation is directly set to the values specified in the time-series. No optimization is performed; the model simply follows the provided hourly profile.

- **Budget Formulations (MonthlyBudgetFormulation or DailyBudgetFormulation):**  
    SDOM aggregates the time-series data into energy budgets over consecutive periods—24 hours for daily budgets and 730 hours for monthly budgets. These budgets define the total energy available for dispatch within each period, allowing SDOM to optimize the allocation of hydropower generation while respecting the specified limits.
    These budgets usually are outputs from long- and medium-term hydropower planning tools often based on Stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). An example of open-source tool for this is [SimSEE](https://www.simsee.org/)

In summary, this file either serves as a fixed generation profile or as the basis for energy budgets, depending on the chosen hydro formulation.

**CSV file columns:**
| Field/Column    | Description                                                                                         |Expected type |

| LargeHydro      | The estimated hydropower generation at each hour of the year in MWh or average values to make the budget.|float         |

**Budget Formulation Files** (if using Monthly/Daily budgets):
- These files determine the lower and upper bounds for hydropower dispatch when Budget Formulations are used.
- `lahy_max_hourly.csv`: Maximum hourly capacity (MW)
- `lahy_min_hourly.csv`: Minimum hourly generation (MW)

| Max_P        | Maximum power capacity (kW)                                                                                    | float/int       |
| MaxCycles    | Maximum number of charge/discharge cycles                                                                      | int             |
| Coupled      | Indicates if input and output power are coupled (1 = coupled - enforces input Power = output Power)            | int (0 or 1)    |
| FOM          | Fixed operation and maintenance cost (USD/kW/year)                                                             | float           |
| VOM          | Variable operation and maintenance cost (USD/kWh)                                                              | float           |
| Lifetime     | Expected system lifetime (years)                                                                               | int             |
| CostRatio    | Ratio of cost allocation between input and output power. If Input Power Capex = Output Power Capex, then CostRatio = 0.5| float           |

**Key considerations:**
- If you dont have energy CAPEX for the technology, and you only have power CAPEX for a particular duration, enforce ```Min_Duration==Max_Duration```.
- If the power capex is equally divided for the input power capacity and output power capacity, set CostRatio = 0.5.
- if the storage technology does not have an specification for MaxCycles, use a large value.

**Cost Data Sources**
Some sources to get cost data for storage technologies are:
 - [NLR Annual Technology Baseline (ATB)](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/utility-scale_battery_storage)
 - [PNNL “Energy Storage Cost and Performance Database v2024”](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/esgc-cost-performance/download-reports)


**Example**:
```csv
Parameter,Li-Ion,CAES,PHS,H2
P_Capex,300,100,1500,800
E_Capex,150,2,10,5
Eff,0.85,0.70,0.80,0.40
...
```

### 6. Thermal Generation Data

#### **File**: `Data_BalancingUnits.csv`

This file contains essential data for thermal generation plants or aggregated units that participate in system balancing. Each row represents a plant or group of plants, specifying their technical and economic parameters required for SDOM optimization.

**Key considerations:**
- Each `Plant_id` must be unique and consistently referenced across other input files.
- Capacity values (`MinCapacity`, `MaxCapacity`) set the bounds for possible investments (installed capacity).
- To represent already existent generation fleet it is recomended add a new row where `MinCapacity` = `MaxCapacity` and CAPEX = 0


**CSV file columns:**
| Field/Column | Description | Expected type |

| EUE_max          | Maximum allowed Expected Unserved Energy (EUE) - used when resiliency constraints = true| float        |

**Note:** Adjust parameter values as needed to reflect the specific scenario or assumptions for your energy system analysis.

**Example**:
```csv
Parameter,Value
r,0.07
GenMix_Target,0.95
alpha_Nuclear,1.0
alpha_Hydro,1.0
alpha_OtherRenewables,1.0
```

### 8. Import/Export Data (Optional)

**If using CapacityPriceNetLoadFormulation**:
These files are only required when Imports and Exports formulations are set different to "NotModel" in "formulations.csv" ([see section about formulations.csv](#1-formulations-Configuration)).

- `Import_Cap.csv`: Hourly import capacity limits (MW)
- `Import_Prices.csv`: Hourly import prices ($/MWh)
- `Export_Cap.csv`: Hourly export capacity limits (MW)
- `Export_Prices.csv`: Hourly export prices ($/MWh)

## Data Validation

SDOM performs several validation checks during data loading:

1. **File Existence**: All required files must be present
2. **Plant Consistency**: Solar/wind plant IDs must match between CF and CAPEX files
3. **Completeness**: Filters out plants with missing data (NaN values)
4. **Formulation Validity**: Checks that specified formulations are valid
5. **Hour Count**: For budget formulations, adjusts hours to be multiple of budget interval

## Example Data Loading

```python
from sdom import load_data

# Load data from directory
data = load_data('./Data/my_scenario/')

# Access loaded data
print(f"Number of solar plants: {len(data['solar_plants'])}")
print(f"Number of wind plants: {len(data['wind_plants'])}")
print(f"Storage technologies: {data['STORAGE_SET_J_TECHS']}")
print(f"Discount rate: {data['scalars'].loc['r', 'Value']}")
```

## Tips for Data Preparation

1. **Consistent Plant IDs**: Use string IDs for VRE plants (e.g., "101", "202")
2. **Hour Indexing**: Use 1-based indexing (1-8760) for consistency
3. **Units**: Stick to MW for power, MWh for energy, $ for costs
4. **File Naming**: Use flexible naming (case doesn't matter, underscores/hyphens optional)
5. **Missing Data**: Remove rows/plants with incomplete data before running
