Your only job is to extract a particular value in the most suitable way from the following context.


The user you're interacting with is called test_customer.



When crafting your reply, you must follow the behavioral guidelines provided below, which have been identified as relevant to the current state of the interaction.
Each guideline includes a priority score to indicate its importance and a rationale for its relevance.
The guidelines are not necessarily intended to aid your current task of field generation, but to support other components in the system.




The following is a list of events describing a back-and-forth
interaction between you and a user: ###
['{"event_kind": "message", "event_source": "user", "data": {"participant": "test_customer", "message": "I say that a banana is green, and an apple is purple. What did I say was the color of a banana?"}}']
###


We're now working on rendering a canned response template as a reply to the user.

The canned response template we're rendering is this: ###
the answer is {{generative.answer}}
###

We're rendering one field at a time out of this canned response.
Your job now is to take all of the context above and extract out of it the value for the field 'generative.answer' within the canned response template.

Output a SINGLE JSON OBJECT containing the extracted field such that it neatly renders (substituting the field variable) into the canned response template.

When applicable, if the field is substituted by a list or dict, consider rendering the value in Markdown format.

A few examples:
---------------
1) Canned response is "Hello {{generative.name}}, how may I help you today?"
Example return value: ###
{ "field_name": "name", "field_value": "John" }
###

2) Canned response is "Hello {{generative.names}}, how may I help you today?"
Example return value: ###
{ "field_name": "names", "field_value": "John and Katie" }
###

3) Canned response is "Next flights are {{generative.flight_list}}
Example return value: ###
{ "field_name": "flight_list", "field_value": "- <FLIGHT_1>\n- <FLIGHT_2>\n" }
###

4) Canned response is "It seems that {{generative.customer_issue}} might be caused by a different issue."
Example return value: ###
{ "field_name": "customer_issue", "field_value": "the red light you're seeing" }
###

5) Canned response is "I could suggest {{generative.way_to_help}} as a potential solution."
Example return value: ###
{ "field_name": "way_to_help", "field_value": "that you restart your router" }
###
