# WuttaPOS

This project includes two primary components:

- web app and related daemons, to run on the server
- standalone GUI app, to run on the lanes

This project is in the very early stages and is not yet documented.
It is based on an earlier effort, which used Rattail:
[rattail/wuttapos](https://forgejo.wuttaproject.org/rattail/wuttapos)

However this project uses Wutta Framework, has no Rattail
dependencies, and "starts over" for (mostly) everything.


## Server

TODO


## Terminal

It uses [Flet](https://flet.dev/) for the GUI toolkit.  The intended
use case is to run as a proper standalone GUI app on the lane desktop.
