===================
 Welcome to Pynche
===================

This is the *Py*\ thonically *N*\ atural *C*\ olor and *H*\ ue *E*\ ditor.

Pynche is based largely on a similar color editor I wrote many years ago for the SunView window system.  That
editor was called ICE: the Interactive Color Editor.  I'd always wanted to port the editor to X but didn't
feel like hacking X and C code to do it.  Fast forward many years, to where Python + Tkinter provided such a
nice programming environment, with enough power, that I finally buckled down and implemented it.  I changed
the name because there were too many other systems have the acronym ``ICE``.
