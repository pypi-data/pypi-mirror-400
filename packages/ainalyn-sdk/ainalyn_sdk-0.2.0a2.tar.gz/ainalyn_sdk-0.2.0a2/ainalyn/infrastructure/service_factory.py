    Create DefinitionService with default adapter implementations.

    This factory isolates the wiring of concrete adapters to ports.
    It provides the default configuration used by most SDK consumers.
    Advanced users can create custom services with their own adapters
    by directly instantiating DefinitionService with custom dependencies.

    Args:
        with_mock_platform_client: If True, includes MockPlatformClient
            for submission features. If False, submission methods will
            raise RuntimeError. Defaults to False (submission NOT available).

    Returns:
        DefinitionService: A fully configured service instance with
            default adapters (SchemaValidator, StaticAnalyzer, YamlExporter,
            and optionally MockPlatformClient).

    Example:
        >>> from ainalyn.infrastructure import create_default_service
        >>> # Default: without submission support
        >>> service = create_default_service()
        >>> result = service.validate(agent_definition)
        >>> if result.is_valid:
        ...     print("Valid!")
        >>>
        >>> # With submission support (uses MockPlatformClient for testing)
        >>> service = create_default_service(with_mock_platform_client=True)

    Note:
        This function creates a new service instance each time it's called.
        For module-level singleton behavior, use the api.py facade functions
        (validate, export_yaml, compile_agent, submit_agent) which maintain
        a cached instance.

    Platform Client Selection:
        - Default: Uses MockPlatformClient (for testing/development)
        - Production: When Platform Core API is ready, replace with
          HttpPlatformClient via custom factory or environment variable
