               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
         
               To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
               boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
               replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

![Omnipy logo](images/omnipy-logo-320.png)

Omnipy is a type-driven Python library for:

- data parsing, wrangling, visualization, and conversion
- tool and web service interoperability, and
- scalable dataflow orchestration

![Conceptual overview of Omnipy](images/omnipy-overview-comics-style.png)


## Why use Omnipy?

**Dataflows, Not Workflows**

Traditional workflows rely on command-line tools and intermediate files, adding complexity to data
pipelines. Omnipy replaces this with dataflows that operate directly in memory or on standard
formats like JSON or CSV. Built on [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) models, Omnipy enhances
data parsing, conversion, and serialization for structured data processing.

**"It's Static Typing!"… "It's Dynamic!"… "It's Omnipy!"**

Omnipy blends Python’s dynamic typing with runtime type safety. Models behave like native Python
structures while ensuring type guarantees without the rigidity of static typing. Defined in Python,
Omnipy models can be as general or specific as needed.

**Parse, Don’t Validate**

Strict validation often breaks pipelines when data is messy. Inspired by
["Parse, don't validate"](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/),
Omnipy eagerly parses input into structured models that retain integrity throughout the pipeline.
This approach aligns with the [Robustness Principle](https://devopedia.org/postel-s-law): _"be
liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send!"_

**Self-Constraining Data Models**

Omnipy models aren’t just one-time validators. A `Model[list[int]]()` behaves like a list but
ensures its elements are always integers. Every modification parses data to enforce integrity,
rolling back invalid operations automatically.

**Omnify Your Data Pipelines**

Omnipy invites you to ["omnify"](https://www.websters1913.com/words/Omnify) pipelines — break them
into reusable, universal components. By defining dataflows and tasks with structured input and
output models, Omnipy simplifies reuse and promotes good coding practices, improving maintainability
as projects grow.

**Catalog of Components for Interoperability**

Omnipy includes components for tasks like asynchronous API requests with rate limiting, parsing JSON
or tabular data, and flattening nested data into relational tables. Integration with REST APIs and
data wrangling/analysis tools like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) simplifies interoperability
across diverse systems. Expect the catalog to grow as the community expands!

**Built to Scale**

Omnipy’s hierarchical `Dataset` structure simplifies batch processing of directory-based data,
including parsing, serialization, and metadata handling. With
built-in [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) support, Omnipy scales seamlessly from local experiments
to distributed deployment, meeting the demands of projects large and small.


## Installing Omnipy

1. Make sure that your Python version is between `3.10` and `3.13` (Python `3.14` is not yet 
   supported), e.g.:

    ```bash
    $ python --version
    Python 3.10.14
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment for your project, e.g.:

    ```bash
    $ python -m venv myproject
    $ source myproject/bin/activate
    ```

    > TIP:
    > - If you need help with setting up a virtual environment, check out the relevant section in
    >   the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/).
    >   _(Please note that Omnipy does not depend on FastAPI, it is just that their documentation is 
    >   excellent!)_
    > - If you are using Omnipy in a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), you can most likely 
    >   skip this step. 

2. Install Omnipy using:
    ```bash
    $ pip install omnipy
    ```

## Getting started

To define an Omnipy data model, simply concretize the generic `Model` class by specifying a 
data type in brackets, e.g. `Model[list[int]]`.

The following creates a data model of a list of integers, and parses some data into that model:

```pycon exec="1" session="greet" source="console"
>>> from omnipy import Model
>>> data = (123, '234', 345.0)  # Note that the input data is a tuple of mixed types
>>> data_as_list_of_ints = Model[list[int]](data)
>>> data_as_list_of_ints  # The data is now parsed into a list of integers
```

```pycon exec="1" session="greet" result="console" html="true"
>>> print(data_as_list_of_ints._docs())
```
 
Omnipy Models are self-constraining, meaning that they will always ensure that the data 
they contain is of the correct type. For example, if you try to append a string to the 
list of integers, it will raise an error:

```pycon
>>> data_as_list_of_ints.append('abc')  # This will raise an error
```

```pycon exec="1" session="greet" result="console"
>>> try:
>>>     data_as_list_of_ints.append('abc')
>>> except Exception as err:
>>>     print(err)
```

Importantly, Omnipy models automatically reverts to snapshots after an error occurs, 
allowing you to retry the operation without having to re-parse the data, continuing
from where you left off. This is particularly useful when working with large dataflows,
as it allows you to handle errors gracefully without losing your progress.

```pycon exec="1" session="greet" source="console"
>>> data_as_list_of_ints
```

```pycon exec="1" session="greet" result="console" html="true"
>>> print(data_as_list_of_ints._docs())
```

```pycon exec="1" session="greet" source="console"
>>> data_as_list_of_ints.append('456')
>>> data_as_list_of_ints
```

```pycon exec="1" session="greet" result="console" html="true"
>>> print(data_as_list_of_ints._docs())
```

## Running example scripts
- Install `omnipy-examples`:
  - `pip install omnipy-examples`
- Example script:
  - `omnipy-examples isajson`
- For help on the command line interface:
  - `omnipy-examples --help`
- For help on a particular example:
  - `omnipy-examples isajson --help`

### Output of flow runs

The output will by default appear in the `data` directory, with a timestamp. 

- It is recommended to install a file viewer that are capable of browsing tar.gz files. 
  For instance, the "File Expander" plugin in PyCharm is excellent for this.
- To unpack the compressed files of a run on the command line 
  (just make sure to replace the datetime string from this example):
  ```
  for f in $(ls data/2023_02_03-12_51_51/*.tar.gz); do mkdir ${f%.tar.gz}; tar xfzv $f -C ${f%.tar.gz}; done
  ```

### Run with the Prefect engine

Omnipy is integrated with the powerful [Prefect](https://prefect.io) dataflow orchestration library.

- To run an example using the `prefect` engine, e.g.:
  - `omnipy-examples --engine prefect isajson`
- After completion of some runs, you can check the flow logs and orchestration options in the Prefect UI:
  - `prefect server start`

More info on Prefect configuration will come soon.
