## Installation

```bash
pip install nimbus-bci
```

To use the optional JAX-based softmax model:

```bash
pip install nimbus-bci[softmax]
```

**From source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nimbusbci/nimbuspysdk.git
cd nimbuspysdk
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

## Quick Start

### sklearn-Compatible API (Recommended)

```python
from nimbus_bci import NimbusLDA, NimbusQDA, NimbusSoftmax, NimbusSTS
import numpy as np

# Create and fit classifier
clf = NimbusLDA()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
probabilities = clf.predict_proba(X_test)

# Online learning
clf.partial_fit(X_new, y_new)
```

### Works with sklearn Pipelines

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, GridSearchCV

# Simple pipeline
pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), NimbusLDA())
pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(NimbusLDA(), X, y, cv=5)
print(f"Accuracy: {scores.mean():.2%} (+/- {scores.std():.2%})")

# Hyperparameter tuning
param_grid = {'mu_scale': [1.0, 3.0, 5.0], 'class_prior_alpha': [0.5, 1.0]}
grid = GridSearchCV(NimbusLDA(), param_grid, cv=5)
grid.fit(X, y)
print(f"Best params: {grid.best_params_}")
```

### Streaming Inference (Real-Time BCI)

```python
from nimbus_bci import NimbusLDA, StreamingSession
from nimbus_bci.data import BCIMetadata

# Setup
metadata = BCIMetadata(
    sampling_rate=250.0,
    paradigm="motor_imagery",
    feature_type="csp",
    n_features=16,
    n_classes=4,
    chunk_size=125,  # 500ms chunks
    temporal_aggregation="logvar",
)

# Train model
clf = NimbusLDA()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create streaming session
session = StreamingSession(clf.model_, metadata)

# Process chunks in real-time
for chunk in eeg_stream:
    result = session.process_chunk(chunk)
    print(f"Chunk prediction: {result.prediction} ({result.confidence:.2%})")

# Finalize trial with aggregation
final = session.finalize_trial(method="weighted_vote")
print(f"Final: class {final.prediction} (entropy: {final.entropy:.2f} bits)")
```

For **NimbusSTS** specifically (stateful latent dynamics), use `StreamingSessionSTS`
so the latent state can be propagated and updated with delayed feedback:

```python
from nimbus_bci import NimbusSTS
from nimbus_bci.inference import StreamingSessionSTS
from nimbus_bci.data import BCIMetadata

metadata = BCIMetadata(
    sampling_rate=250.0,
    paradigm="motor_imagery",
    feature_type="csp",
    n_features=16,
    n_classes=2,
    chunk_size=125,
    temporal_aggregation="mean",
)

clf = NimbusSTS().fit(X_train, y_train)
session = StreamingSessionSTS(clf, metadata)

result = session.process_chunk(chunk)  # propagates state by default
session.provide_feedback(label=0)      # when label arrives later
```

### Batch Inference with Diagnostics

```python
from nimbus_bci import predict_batch
from nimbus_bci.data import BCIData, BCIMetadata

# Create BCI data container
metadata = BCIMetadata(
    sampling_rate=250.0,
    paradigm="motor_imagery",
    feature_type="csp",
    n_features=16,
    n_classes=4,
)
data = BCIData(features, metadata, labels)

# Run batch inference with full diagnostics
result = predict_batch(model, data)

print(f"Mean entropy: {result.mean_entropy:.2f} bits")
print(f"Balance: {result.balance:.2%}")
print(f"ECE: {result.calibration.ece:.3f}")
print(f"Latency: {result.latency_ms:.1f}ms")
```

### MNE-Python Integration

```python
import mne
from nimbus_bci import NimbusLDA
from nimbus_bci.compat import from_mne_epochs, extract_csp_features

# Load and preprocess with MNE
raw = mne.io.read_raw_gdf("motor_imagery.gdf")
events = mne.find_events(raw)
epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, tmin=0, tmax=4, baseline=None, preload=True)
epochs.filter(8, 30)  # Mu + Beta bands

# Extract CSP features
csp_features, csp = extract_csp_features(epochs, n_components=8)

# Train Nimbus classifier
clf = NimbusLDA()
clf.fit(csp_features, epochs.events[:, 2])
```

## Available Classifiers

| Classifier | Description | Best For |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `NimbusLDA` | Bayesian LDA with shared covariance | Fast, when classes have similar shapes |
| `NimbusQDA` | Bayesian QDA with class-specific covariances | Complex class distributions |
| `NimbusSoftmax` | Bayesian logistic regression (Polya-Gamma VI) | Non-Gaussian decision boundaries |
| `NimbusSTS` | Structural time series classifier (latent state + EKF-style inference) | Non-stationary settings, drifting class boundaries (experimental) |

## Choosing the Right Classifier

### Quick Decision Guide

**Is your data stationary (distributions don't change over time)?**
- **Yes** → Use static models (LDA/GMM/Softmax)
- **No** → Use `NimbusSTS` for temporal adaptation

**For stationary data:**
- **Classes have similar covariance?** → `NimbusLDA` (fastest)
- **Classes have different shapes?** → `NimbusQDA`
- **Non-Gaussian boundaries?** → `NimbusSoftmax`

**For non-stationary data:**
- **Gradual drift (fatigue, electrode shift)?** → `NimbusSTS`
- **Multi-day sessions with state transfer?** → `NimbusSTS`
- **Delayed feedback paradigms?** → `NimbusSTS`

### Detailed Comparison

| Scenario | Recommended Model | Why? |
|----------|-------------------|------|
| **Stable offline datasets** | `NimbusLDA` | Fastest, closed-form solution |
| **P300 spelling (stable)** | `NimbusLDA` or `NimbusQDA` | Event-related, stationary |
| **SSVEP** | `NimbusLDA` | Highly stationary frequency response |
| **Motor Imagery (short sessions)** | `NimbusLDA` or `NimbusQDA` | Stationary within session |
| **Motor Imagery (long sessions, fatigue)** | `NimbusSTS` | Tracks drift due to fatigue |
| **Multi-day experiments** | `NimbusSTS` | State transfer across sessions |
| **Electrode repositioning** | `NimbusSTS` | Adapts to impedance changes |
| **Closed-loop with delayed feedback** | `NimbusSTS` | Explicit state propagation |
| **Asynchronous BCI (idle vs active)** | `NimbusSTS` | Models engagement state |
| **Neurofeedback training** | `NimbusSTS` | Tracks learning-induced changes |

### NimbusSTS Example (Temporal Adaptation)

```python
from nimbus_bci import NimbusSTS

# Train on calibration data
clf = NimbusSTS(transition_cov=0.05, num_steps=50)
clf.fit(X_calibration, y_calibration)

# Online session with delayed feedback
for x_trial, y_feedback in online_trials:
    # 1. Propagate state forward (no label needed)
    clf.propagate_state()
    
    # 2. Make prediction
    prediction = clf.predict(x_trial)
    
    # ... user performs action, feedback arrives later ...
    
    # 3. Update with true label
    clf.partial_fit(x_trial, y_feedback)

# Multi-day state transfer
z_day1, P_day1 = clf.get_latent_state()

# Day 2: Initialize with Day 1 state (increased uncertainty)
clf_day2 = NimbusSTS()
clf_day2.fit(X_day2_calib, y_day2_calib)
clf_day2.set_latent_state(z_day1 * 0.5, P_day1 * 2.0)
```

## Label Conventions (Important)

Nimbus supports common EEG/BCI labeling patterns:

- **BCIData labels**: can be any **non-negative integer codes** (e.g., MNE event IDs like 769/770),
  as long as the number of unique labels does not exceed `BCIMetadata.n_classes`.
- **sklearn estimators** (`NimbusLDA`, `NimbusQDA`, `NimbusSoftmax`, `NimbusSTS`):
  - `fit()` learns `classes_` from your provided labels.
  - `predict()` returns labels in the **original label space** (elements of `classes_`).
- **Model-snapshot inference** (`NimbusModel` + `predict_batch` / `StreamingSession`):
  - predictions are returned in the model’s **label_base** convention (`label_base` is stored in `model.params`).
  - use `nimbus_bci.data.labels_to_zero_indexed(...)` for metrics/aggregation that require 0-indexed labels.

## NimbusSTS Sequence Semantics (Important)

`NimbusSTS` has a latent state. For correctness and sklearn compatibility:

- `NimbusSTS.predict_proba(X)` treats rows as **conditionally independent** by default.
- For **time-ordered** evaluation, propagate explicitly:
  - call `clf.propagate_state()` between trials/chunks, or
  - use the functional API `nimbus_sts_predict_proba(model, X, evolve_state=True)` when `X` rows are ordered in time.

## Metrics & Diagnostics

```python
from nimbus_bci import (
    compute_entropy,            # Prediction uncertainty
    compute_calibration_metrics,  # ECE, MCE
    calculate_itr,              # Information Transfer Rate
    assess_trial_quality,       # Quality checks
)

# Entropy (uncertainty)
entropy = compute_entropy(posterior)  # bits

# Calibration
calib = compute_calibration_metrics(predictions, confidences, labels)
print(f"ECE: {calib.ece:.3f}, MCE: {calib.mce:.3f}")

# ITR
itr = calculate_itr(accuracy=0.85, n_classes=4, trial_duration=4.0)
print(f"ITR: {itr:.1f} bits/min")
```

## Normalization

Critical for cross-session BCI performance:

```python
from nimbus_bci import estimate_normalization_params, apply_normalization

# Estimate from training data
params = estimate_normalization_params(X_train, method="zscore")

# Apply to all data
X_train_norm = apply_normalization(X_train, params)
X_test_norm = apply_normalization(X_test, params)  # Same params!
```

## Functional API (Backward Compatible)

The original functional API is still available:

```python
from nimbus_bci import (
    nimbus_lda_fit, nimbus_lda_predict, nimbus_lda_update,
    nimbus_qda_fit, nimbus_qda_predict,
    nimbus_softmax_fit, nimbus_softmax_predict,
    nimbus_save, nimbus_load,
)

# Fit model
model = nimbus_lda_fit(X, y, n_classes=4, label_base=0, ...)

# Predict
probs = nimbus_lda_predict_proba(model, X_test)

# Update (online learning)
model = nimbus_lda_update(model, X_new, y_new)

# Save/load
nimbus_save(model, "model.npz")
model = nimbus_load("model.npz")
```
