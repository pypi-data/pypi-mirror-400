# Siegert Scatter

Compute 1D and radial (partial-wave) Schrödinger scattering using the Siegert pseudostate (SPS) method. This library produces S-matrices, cross sections, Wigner time delays, and scattering lengths for user-defined potentials.

## Installation

```bash
pip install siegert-scatter
```

## Usage

```python
import siegert_scatter

# Usage example coming soon
```
