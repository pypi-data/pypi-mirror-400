"""Geometry simplification functions.

This module provides high-level functions for simplifying Shapely geometries
by removing or snapping vertices based on various criteria. All public functions
accept and return Shapely geometry objects.

Includes wrappers for the high-performance simplification library algorithms:
- Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP)
- Visvalingam-Whyatt (VW)
- Topology-preserving Visvalingam-Whyatt (VWP)

    """Collapse edges shorter than min_length by snapping vertices together.

    This function cleans up geometries by collapsing very short edges. This is useful
    for removing noise, fixing numerical issues, or simplifying geometries with
    unnecessary detail at small scales.

    Args:
        geometry: Shapely geometry to process (any type)
        min_length: Minimum edge length threshold. Edges shorter than this will be collapsed.
        snap_mode: How to snap vertices together:
            - CollapseMode.MIDPOINT: Snap both vertices to their midpoint (default)
            - CollapseMode.FIRST: Keep the first vertex, remove the second
            - CollapseMode.LAST: Remove the first vertex, keep the second

    Returns:
        New Shapely geometry of the same type with short edges removed

    Examples:
        >>> from polyforge.core.types import CollapseMode
        >>> poly = Polygon([(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 0.01), (10, 10), (0, 10)])

    Args:
        geometry: Shapely geometry to simplify (any type)

            line segments will be removed. Larger values = more simplification.
