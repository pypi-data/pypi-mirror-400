## Description

Finally there is a real searchkit application for django that integrates best
with the django admin backend.

You have tons of admin changelist filters and still you are not able to filter
your items exactly as you need it? Or once and again you need a combination of
several changelist filters and you are tired of waiting for each filter being
applied one after the other? Or you just don't want to write a custom changelist
filter for each special requirement of your customers.

Then django-searchkit is for you. Give it a try. You get a nice and handy
formset to build complex searches with as many filter rules as you want over all
of your model fields or the fields of related models.


## Features

- Build and apply complex searches using a dynamic formset with a ...
- ...clear and easy to use layout.
- Add as many filter rules as you want using django's various [field lookups](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups).
- Chain filter rules by logical operators like AND or OR.
- Filter over fields of related models.
- Save and reuse your searches at any time by a handy admin changelist filter.


## Setup

Install via pip:
```
pip install django-searchkit
```

Add `searchkit` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
   'searchkit',
   'django.contrib.admin',
   ...
]
```
Put `searchkit` in front of `django.contrib.admin` since we do some template
overwriting.


Include the searchkit.urls into your project urlpatterns:
```
urlpatterns = [
   path('searchkit/', include('searchkit.urls')),
   ...
]
```

Add the `SearkitFilter` to your `ModelAdmin`:
```
from django.contrib import admin
from searchkit.filters import SearchkitFilter
from .models import MyModel


@admin.register(MyModel)
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
   ...
    list_filter = [
      SearchkitFilter,
      ...
      ]
   ...
```

## Usage

1. Open the admin changelist of your Model.
2. Click the "Add search" button of the Searchkit filter.
3. Give your Filter a name.
4. Configure as many filter rules as you want.
5. Click "Save and apply".
6. Reuse your filter whenever you want using the Searchkit filter section.
