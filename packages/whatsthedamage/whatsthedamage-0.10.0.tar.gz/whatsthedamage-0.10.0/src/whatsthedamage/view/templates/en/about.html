        <h1>What's the Damage</h1>
        <p>This tool is designed to process CSV files and generate insightful reports. It relies on your bank's export functionality to save your historical data into CSV format.</p>
        <p>Efforts were made to be able to customize the behavior and potentially work with any CSV format finance companies may produce.</p>
        <p>It is published under GPL-3.0 license.</p>
        <h2>The problem it solves</h2>
        <p>My bank service provider gives me reports about my finances but they are not detailed enough, so I created my own.</p>
        <p>Also my financial details are a private matter between myself and my chosen bank. To process my bank account exports, I need a solution that ensures only I have access to the data.</p>

        <p class="bg-warning">This application does not keep or sell any of your data. All uploaded content is removed as soon as the report is created.</p>
        <h2>Main Features</h2>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Filter transactions by start and end dates, or group them by month for a comprehensive overview of your finances.</li>
            <li><strong>Detailed Reporting:</strong> Generate summarized reports that provide insights into your spending habits, grouped by transaction categories.</li>
            <li><strong>CSV Export:</strong> Save your reports as CSV files for easy sharing and further analysis.</li>
