"""

otupy provides an opensource implementation of the OpenC2 language and support for 
integration of encoding formats and protocol syntax.

All language elements are named according to the standard, with minor variations to
account for reserved keywords and characters.

All the target and data types defined by the standard are available for creating OpenC2 
commands.

This is the code documentation for using and extending open2lib.
Please read the the quick start (:any:`usage`)  and the advanced documentation (:any:`developerguide`) 
for an overview of otupy operation. 

This documentation uses docstrings in the Python code. You can regenerate it by running 

.. code-block:: python3

	pdoc -o docs/code src/otupy

or you can run your own websever with:

.. code-block:: python3

	pdoc src/otupy/

(TODO: fix errors with the pdoc webserver).
