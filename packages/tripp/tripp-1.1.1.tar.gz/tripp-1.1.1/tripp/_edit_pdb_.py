def mutate(universe, mutation_selections, temp_name):

    Function that deletes all atoms of a residue except for a methyl group. 
    The residue is then renamed to alanine. 
    Parameters
    ----------
    universe: MDAnalysis.universe
        MDAnalysis universe. The universe after create_predictor_compatible_universe
        modifications should be used here.
    mutation_selections: str
        A string (MDAnalysis selection syntax) to select the 
        residues to be pseudo-mutated.
    temp_name: str
        The name of the temporary PDB file to be created with the mutated residue.
    Exceptions
    ----------
    Exception
        If the residue type is GLY, an exception is raised.
