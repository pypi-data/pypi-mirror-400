## at SCTRL_BREAKPOINT_INSERT:
### ECX = controller index in state, EBP = player pointer
## breakpoints are complicated because trying to set breakpoints on a specific controller would mean breaking hundreds of times per frame.
## to avoid the laggy mess this results in, i inject code into MUGEN to handle breakpoint checking itself.
## basically this looks like this:
### - at SCTRL_BREAKPOINT_INSERT, set a JUMP to SCTRL_BREAKPOINT_FUNC_ADDR
### - at SCTRL_BREAKPOINT_TABLE, insert a table with all the known breakpoints
### - at SCTRL_BREAKPOINT_FUNC, insert code to scan the breakpoint table and trigger a breakpoint if a stateno/index pair matches
### - whenever a breakpoint gets set or deleted, updated the table at SCTRL_BREAKPOINT_TABLE.
