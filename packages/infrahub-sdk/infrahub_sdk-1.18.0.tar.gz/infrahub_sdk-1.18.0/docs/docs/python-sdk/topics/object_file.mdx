# Manage data with Object files

## Introduction

An Object file is a YAML file that allows you to manage data to be loaded in Infrahub based on your own custom schema. It provides a declarative way to define and manage resources in your Infrahub instance.

Object files work well for models that don't change too often and/or that need to be tracked in Git. Examples include: Groups, tags, Users, etc.
Below is an example of an Object file that defines tags (`BuiltinTag`).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Object
spec:
  kind: BuiltinTag
  data:
    - name: Blue
    - name: Yellow
    - name: Red
```

Object files are meant to be used in an idempotent way and as such they work better for models with a Human Friendly ID (HFID) defined. An HFID is a unique identifier that makes it easier to reference objects across different files and operations.

## Load Object files into Infrahub

Object files can be loaded into Infrahub using the `infrahubctl object load` command.

```bash
infrahubctl object load <path_to_object_file>
```

Multiple object files can be loaded at once by specifying the path to multiple files or by specifying a directory.

The `object load` command will create/update the objects using an `Upsert` operation. All objects previously loaded will NOT be deleted in the Infrahub instance.
Also, if some objects present in different files are identical and dependent on each other, the `object load` command will NOT calculate the dependencies between the objects and as such it's the responsibility of the users to execute the command in the right order.

> Object files can also be loaded into Infrahub when using external Git repositories. To see how to do this, please refer to the [.infrahub.yml](https://docs.infrahub.app/topics/infrahub-yml) documentation.

### Validate the format of object files

The object file can be validated using the `infrahubctl object validate` command.

```bash
infrahubctl object validate <path_to_object_file>
```

## Object file format

All object files must start with the following format, all other formats will be automatically ignored.
Each file is intended for one specific top level kind, but one file can include multiple nested objects of any kind.
The kind of the top level object must be defined in spec/kind.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Object
spec:
  kind: <NamespaceName>
  parameters:
    expand_range: <boolean>  # Optional, defaults to false
  data:
    - [...]
```

> Multiple documents in a single YAML file are also supported, each document will be loaded separately. Documents are separated by `---`

### Data Processing Parameters

The `parameters` field controls how the data in the object file is processed before loading into Infrahub:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                             | Default |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `expand_range` | When set to `true`, range patterns (e.g., `[1-5]`) in string fields are expanded into multiple objects. | `false` |

When `expand_range` is not specified, it defaults to `false`.

### Relationship of cardinality one

A relationship of cardinality one can either reference an existing node via its HFID or create a new node if it doesn't exist.
In the example below, both `site` and `primary_ip` are relationships of cardinality one.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Object
spec:
  kind: InfraDevice
  data:
    - name: edge01
      site: "Paris"         # Reference existing node via its HFID
      primary_ip:           # Nested object, will be created if it doesn't exist
        data:
            address: "192.168.1.1"
```

### Relationship of cardinality many

A relationship of cardinality many can reference existing nodes via their HFID or define nested objects.

#### Existing nodes referenced by their HFID

Existing nodes can be referenced by their HFID in string format or in list format.
In the example below, both `best_friends` and `tags` are relationships of cardinality many.

> An HFID is composed of a single value, it's possible to use a string instead of a list

```yaml
---
apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Object
spec:
  kind: TestingPerson
  data:
    - name: Mike Johnson
      height: 175
      best_friends: # Relationship of cardinality many that references existing nodes based on their HFID
        - [Jane Smith, Max]
        - [Sarah Williams, Charlie]
      tags:
        - Veterinarian    # Existing Node referenced by its HFID in string format
        - [Breeder]       # Existing Node referenced by its HFID in list format
```

#### Nested objects

When defining nested objects, the node will be automatically created if it doesn't exist and if the relationship between the parent object and the nested object exists, it will be automatically inserted.
For example, in the example below, the `owner` of a `TestingDog` doesn't need to be specified because it will be automatically inserted.

Two different syntax are supported:

- A dictionary with multiple values under data
- A list of objects

##### Nested objects as a dictionary

In the example below, `tags` is a relationship of cardinality many that is defined as a dictionary with multiple values under data.

> The kind is optional here because there is only one option possible (not a generic)

```yaml
---
apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Object
spec:
  kind: TestingPerson
  data:
    - name: Alex Thompson
      tags:
        data:
          - name: dog-lover
            description: "Dog Lover"
          - name: veterinarian
            description: "Veterinarian"
```

This format works well when all objects are of the same kind and when all objects are using the same properties.
For more complex cases, the list of objects format is more flexible.

##### Nested objects as a list of objects

In the example below, `animals` is a relationship of cardinality many that is defined as a list of objects.
Each object must contain a `data` key and each object can also define a specific `kind`.

> If the kind is not specified, it will be inferred from schema

```yaml
---
apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Object
spec:
  kind: TestingPerson
  data:
    - name: Alex Thompson
      height: 180
      animals:
        - kind: TestingDog
          data:
            name: Max
            weight: 25
            breed: Golden Retriever
            color: "#FFD700"
        - kind: TestingCat
          data:
            name: Mimi
            breed: Persian
```

### Support for metadata

Metadata support is planned for future releases. Currently, the Object file does not support metadata on attributes or relationships.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

1. **Objects not being created**: Ensure that the YAML syntax is correct and that the file follows the required format.
2. **Dependency errors**: When objects depend on each other, load them in the correct order (dependencies first).
3. **Validation errors**: Use the `infrahubctl object validate` command to check for syntax errors before loading.

### Best practices

1. Use Human Friendly IDs (HFIDs) for all objects to ensure consistent referencing.
2. Keep object files organized by model type or purpose.
3. Validate object files before loading them into production environments.
4. Use comments in your YAML files to document complex relationships or dependencies.

## Range Expansion in Object Files

The Infrahub Python SDK supports **range expansion** for string fields in object files when the `parameters > expand_range` is set to `true`. This feature allows you to specify a range pattern (e.g., `[1-5]`) in any string value, and the SDK will automatically expand it into multiple objects during validation and processing.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Object
spec:
  kind: BuiltinLocation
  parameters:
    expand_range: true  # Enable range expansion
  data:
    - name: AMS[1-3]
      type: Country
```

### How Range Expansion Works

- Any string field containing a pattern like `[1-5]`, `[10-15]`, or `[1,3,5]` will be expanded into multiple objects.
- If multiple fields in the same object use range expansion, **all expanded lists must have the same length**. If not, validation will fail.
- The expansion is performed before validation and processing, so all downstream logic works on the expanded data.

### Examples

#### Single Field Expansion

```yaml
spec:
  kind: BuiltinLocation
  parameters:
    expand_range: true
  data:
    - name: AMS[1-3]
      type: Country
```

This will expand to:

```yaml
- name: AMS1
  type: Country
- name: AMS2
  type: Country
- name: AMS3
  type: Country
```

#### Multiple Field Expansion (Matching Lengths)

```yaml
spec:
  kind: BuiltinLocation
  parameters:
    expand_range: true
  data:
    - name: AMS[1-3]
      description: Datacenter [A-C]
      type: Country
```

This will expand to:

```yaml
- name: AMS1
  description: Datacenter A
  type: Country
- name: AMS2
  description: Datacenter B
  type: Country
- name: AMS3
  description: Datacenter C
  type: Country
```

#### Error: Mismatched Range Lengths

If you use ranges of different lengths in multiple fields:

```yaml
spec:
  kind: BuiltinLocation
  parameters:
    expand_range: true
  data:
    - name: AMS[1-3]
      description: "Datacenter [10-15]"
      type: Country
```

This will **fail validation** with an error like:

```bash
Range expansion mismatch: fields expanded to different lengths: [3, 6]
```

### Notes

- Range expansion is supported for any string field in the `data` section.
- If no range pattern is present, the field is left unchanged.
- If expansion fails for any field, validation will fail with an error message.
