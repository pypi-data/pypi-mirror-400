## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.structure import SOMA CoreMultiModel

# Create multi-model system
multi_model = SOMA CoreMultiModel()

# Learn from data
text = "cat cat dog cat mouse python java"
multi_model.learn(text)

# Analyze with ALL models
result = multi_model.analyze("cat")

# Get comprehensive understanding
print(f"Comprehensive Score: {result.integrated['comprehensive_score']}")
print(f"Model Coverage: {result.integrated['model_coverage']}/8")
```

### Deep Reasoning

```python
from src.structure import DeepStructuralReasoner

reasoner = DeepStructuralReasoner()
reasoner.learn_from_text(text)

# Reason from ALL perspectives
result = reasoner.reason_about("cat")

# Get insights from each perspective
for perspective, insights in result['insights'].items():
    print(f"{perspective}: {len(insights)} insights")
```

### Relationship Graph

```python
from src.structure import RelationshipGraph

graph = RelationshipGraph(registry, builder, hierarchy)
graph.build_from_text(text)

# Get comprehensive understanding
understanding = graph.get_understanding("cat")
print(f"Relationships: {understanding['total_relationships']}")
print(f"Perspectives: {understanding['perspective_coverage']}")
```

### Data Understanding

```python
from src.structure import DataUnderstanding

understanding = DataUnderstanding()
result = understanding.understand_data(text)

# Get overall understanding
overall = result['overall_understanding']
print(f"Overall Score: {overall.overall_score}")
print(f"Structural: {overall.structural_understanding}")
print(f"Semantic: {overall.semantic_understanding}")
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Perspective Analysis

**6 Perspectives:**
- Structural (how things are built)
- Semantic (what things mean)
- Frequency (how often things appear)
- Contextual (where things appear)
- Temporal (how things change)
- Relational (how things connect)

### 2. Deep Symbol Understanding

**Understands from ALL angles:**
- Symbol type (letter, number, math, special)
- Usage patterns (frequency, positions)
- Combinations (what it combines with)
- Pattern participation (what patterns contain it)

### 3. Deep Pattern Understanding

**Understands from ALL angles:**
- Structural composition (symbols)
- Stability and frequency
- Relationships with other patterns
- Hierarchical position

### 4. Relationship Understanding

**From ALL angles:**
- Symbol relationships (overlap, containment)
- Pattern relationships (structural, semantic)
- Co-occurrence relationships
- Frequency relationships
- Contextual relationships
- Hierarchical relationships

### 5. Comprehensive Understanding

**Combines ALL perspectives:**
- Overall understanding score
- Perspective-specific scores
- Relationship coverage
- Model integration
