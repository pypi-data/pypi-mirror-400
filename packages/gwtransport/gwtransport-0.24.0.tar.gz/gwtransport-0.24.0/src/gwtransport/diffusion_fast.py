"""
Fast Diffusive Transport Corrections via Gaussian Smoothing.

This module provides a computationally efficient approximation of diffusion/dispersion
using Gaussian smoothing. It is much faster than :mod:`gwtransport.diffusion` but
less physically accurate, especially under variable flow conditions.

**When to use diffusion_fast vs diffusion:**

- Use ``diffusion_fast`` when: Speed is critical, flow and time steps are relatively
  constant, or you need real-time processing
- Use ``diffusion`` when: Physical accuracy is critical, flow varies significantly,
  or you're analyzing periods with changing conditions

See :ref:`concept-dispersion` for background on dispersion processes.

This module implements diffusion/dispersion processes that modify advective transport
in aquifer systems. Diffusion causes spreading and smoothing of concentration or
temperature fronts as they travel through the aquifer. While advection moves compounds
with water flow, diffusion causes spreading due to molecular diffusion, mechanical
dispersion, and thermal diffusion (for temperature).

Limitation: This fast approximation works best when flow and tedges are relatively
constant. The underlying assumption is that dx (spatial step between cells) remains
approximately constant, which holds for steady flow but breaks down under highly
variable conditions. For scenarios with significant flow variability, consider using
:mod:`gwtransport.diffusion` instead.

Available functions:

- :func:`infiltration_to_extraction` - Apply diffusion during infiltration to extraction
  transport. Combines advection (via residence time) with diffusion (via Gaussian smoothing).
  Computes position-dependent diffusion based on local residence time and returns concentration
  or temperature in extracted water.

- :func:`extraction_to_infiltration` - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. Inverse diffusion is numerically
  unstable and requires regularization techniques. Placeholder for future implementation.

- :func:`compute_scaled_sigma_array` - Calculate position-dependent diffusion parameters. Computes
  standard deviation (sigma) for Gaussian smoothing at each time step based on residence time,
  diffusivity, and spatial discretization: sigma = sqrt(2 * diffusivity * residence_time) / dx.

- :func:`convolve_diffusion` - Apply variable-sigma Gaussian filtering. Extends
  scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter1d to position-dependent sigma using sparse matrix representation
  for efficiency. Handles boundary conditions via nearest-neighbor extrapolation.

- :func:`deconvolve_diffusion` - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. Inverse filtering placeholder for future
  diffusion deconvolution with required regularization for stability.

- :func:`create_example_data` - Generate test data for demonstrating diffusion effects with
  signals having varying time steps and corresponding sigma arrays. Useful for testing and
  validation.

    Sigma represents the dimensionless spreading parameter for Gaussian filtering,

    The computation follows these steps:

    1. Calculate residence time (rt) for water parcels traveling through the aquifer
    2. Compute the diffusive spreading length: L_diff = sqrt(2 * D * rt) [m].
       This is the physical distance over which concentrations spread due to diffusion.

       This is the physical distance the water moves during one time step.
    4. Sigma = L_diff / dx converts the physical spreading into array index units.

    Why divide by dx? The Gaussian filter operates on array indices, not physical
    distances. If the diffusive spreading is 10 meters and each time step moves
    water 2 meters, then sigma = 10/2 = 5 means the filter should blend across

    input_signal : numpy.ndarray

    Notes
    -----
    At the boundaries, the outer values are repeated to avoid edge effects. Equal to mode=`nearest`

    The function constructs a sparse convolution matrix where each row represents
    a position-specific Gaussian kernel. The kernel width adapts to local sigma
    values, making it suitable for problems with varying diffusivitys
    or time steps.

    For diffusion problems, the local sigma values can be calculated as:
    sigma = sqrt(2 * diffusivity * dt) / dx
    where diffusivity is the diffusivity, dt is the time step, and dx is the
    spatial step size.

    The implementation uses sparse matrices for memory efficiency when dealing
    with large signals or when sigma values vary significantly.
