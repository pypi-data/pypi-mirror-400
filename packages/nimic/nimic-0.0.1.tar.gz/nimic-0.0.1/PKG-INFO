# Nimic
Nimic is a pure Python module that facilitates writing AOT compilable code with a subset of Python (domain specific language). Based on ctypes built-in module, it includes emulation of native types, pointers and operations on them, implementing dispatch, operator overloading, and templates. Nimic closely follows Nim programming language, to which nimic code transpiles.
