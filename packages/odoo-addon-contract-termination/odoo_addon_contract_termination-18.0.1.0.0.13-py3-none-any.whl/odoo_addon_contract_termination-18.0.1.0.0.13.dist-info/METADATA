| The **Contract Termination** module extends the ``contract`` module,
  allowing users to properly manage the termination of contracts.
| It provides functionality to terminate contracts with a reason, track
  termination comments and dates, and prevent further modifications on
  terminated contracts unless reactivated.

Features
--------

- **Terminate Contracts**

  - Users with the appropriate rights can terminate active contracts.
  - Capture a termination reason, comment, and termination date.

- **Update or Cancel Termination**

  - Update termination details if needed.
  - Cancel (reactivate) a terminated contract.

- **Contract Form Enhancements**

  - Display an alert on terminated contracts with the reason and
    comment.
  - Hide or disable contract actions (e.g., Send) and fields on
    terminated contracts.
  - Set contract fields as read-only after termination.

- **Permissions**

  - Only users with the group ``Contract: Can Terminate Contracts`` can
    terminate or cancel termination of contracts.
