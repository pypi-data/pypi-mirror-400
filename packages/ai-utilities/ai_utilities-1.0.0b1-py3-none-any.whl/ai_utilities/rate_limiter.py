rate_limiter.py

This module provides the `RateLimiter` class, which manages and enforces rate limits for API calls.
It ensures that requests and token usage are constrained according to predefined limits, such as
Requests Per Minute (RPM), Tokens Per Minute (TPM), and Tokens Per Day (TPD). The `RateLimiter`
also supports multithreaded environments, making it safe to use across concurrent requests.

Key functionalities include:
- Enforcing rate limits for requests and token usage based on predefined settings.
- Providing thread-safe access to shared resources to prevent race conditions.
- Automatically resetting daily and per-minute limits for API usage.
- Recording usage and saving statistics to a file to persist limits across sessions.
- Supporting background timers for periodic resets of the per-minute counters.

Example usage:

from rate_limiter import RateLimiter

# Initialize rate limiter with specific limits for API usage
rate_limiter = RateLimiter(module_name="test-model-1", rpm=60, tpm=1000, tpd=10000)

# Check if a request with 500 tokens can proceed
if rate_limiter.can_proceed(500):
    # Record the usage once the request is made
    rate_limiter.record_usage(500)
    print("Request can proceed")
else:
    print("Rate limit exceeded")

# Start the background thread to reset the per-minute counters
rate_limiter.start_reset_timer()
