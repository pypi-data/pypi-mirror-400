    """Aggregate expression values across genes, potentially with weights.
    This is typically used to summarize expression values for gene sets into a single per-cell score.

    Args:
        x:
            Matrix-like object where rows correspond to genes or genomic features and columns correspond to cells. 
            Values are expected to be log-expression values.

        sets:
            Sequence of gene sets.
            Each gene set may be represented by:

            - A sequence of integers, specifying the row indices of the genes in that set.
            - A sequence of strings, specifying the row names of the genes in that set.
              If any strings are present, ``row_names`` should also be supplied.
            - A tuple of length 2, containing a sequence of strings/integers (row names/indices) and a numeric array (weights).
            - A :py:class:`~biocframe.BiocFrame.BiocFrame` where each row corresponds to a gene.
              The first column contains the row names/indices and the second column contains the weights.

            Alternatively, a dictionary may be supplied where each key is the name of a gene set and each value is a sequence/tuple as described above.
            The keys will be used to name the output ``NamedList``.

            Alternatively, a :py:class:`~biocutils.NamedList.NamedList` where each entry is a gene set represented by a sequence/tuple as described above.
            If names are available, they will be used to name the output ``NamedList``.

        row_names:
            Sequence of strings of length equal to the number of rows of ``x``, containing the name of each gene.
            Duplicate names are allowed but only the first occurrence will be used.
            If ``None``, rows are assumed to be unnamed.

        average:
            Whether to compute the average rather than the sum.

        num_threads: 
            Number of threads to be used for aggregation.

    Returns:
        A :py:class:`~biocutils.NamedList.NamedList` of length equal to that of ``sets``.
        Each entry is a numeric vector of length equal to the number of columns in ``x``,
        containing the (weighted) sum/mean of expression values for the corresponding set across all cells.

        >>>     "bar": range(10, 40, 2)
        >>> } 
        >>> aggr = scranpy.aggregate_across_genes(mat, sets)
