# Craft Parts

[![Documentation Status][rtd-badge]][rtd-latest]

Craft Parts supports the _parts_ mechanism common to all craft applications. It
provides a declarative way to obtain, process, and organize data from different sources
before it is packaged into the final artifact.

This library is most useful for app developers in the Starcraft family.

## Documentation

The [Craft Parts documentation][rtd-latest] describes the library's key components and
provides guidance on its usage.
