# TRANSIENT SIMULATION CLASS ============================================================

class Simulation:
    """Class that performs transient analysis of the dynamical system, defined by the 
    blocks and connecions. It manages all the blocks and connections and the timestep update.

    The global system equation is evaluated by fixed point iteration, so the information from 
    each timestep gets distributed within the entire system and is available for all blocks at 
    all times.

    The minimum number of fixed-point iterations 'iterations_min' is set to 'None' by default 
    and then the length of the longest internal signal path (with passthrough) is used as the 
    estimate for minimum number of iterations needed for the information to reach all instant 
    time blocks in each timestep. Dont change this unless you know that the actual path is 
    shorter or something similar that prohibits instant time information flow. 

    Convergence check for the fixed-point iteration loop with 'tolerance_fpi' is based on 
    max absolute error (max-norm) to previous iteration and should not be touched.

    Multiple numerical integrators are implemented in the 'pathsim.solvers' module. 
    The default solver is a fixed timestep 2nd order Strong Stability Preserving Runge Kutta 
    (SSPRK22) method which is quite fast and has ok accuracy, especially if you are forced to 
    take small steps to cover the behaviour of forcing functions. Adaptive timestepping and 
    implicit integrators are also available.
    
    Manages an event handling system based on zero crossing detection. Uses 'Event' objects 
    to monitor solver states of stateful blocks and applys transformations on the state in 
    case an event is detected. 

    Example
    -------

    This is how to setup a simple system simulation using the 'Simulation' class:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pathsim import Simulation, Connection
        from pathsim.blocks import Source, Integrator, Scope

        src = Source(lambda t: np.cos(2*np.pi*t))
        itg = Integrator()
        sco = Scope(labels=["source", "integrator"])
        
        sim = Simulation(
            blocks=[src, itg, sco],
            connections=[
                Connection(src[0], itg[0], sco[0]),

                ],
