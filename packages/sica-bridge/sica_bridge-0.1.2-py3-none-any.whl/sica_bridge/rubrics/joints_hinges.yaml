# Note: The following rubrics are only proposed suggestions. The final version should be confirmed by the Engineer.

id: hinges_joints
version: 2
scope:
  component: "Intermediate Deck Joints and Hinges"
  intent: "Post-earthquake expansion joint and hinge seat assessment"

r_states:
  R1:
    label: "Open"
    cues:
      - "Joint/hinge configuration appears consistent with the designed geometry (e.g., half-joint/drop-in/seat recess may be present)."
      - "Expansion joint region appears clear and functional with no visible structural distress."
      - "Railing/barrier across the joint appears continuous and aligned."
      - "No visible cracking, spalling, crushing, or fractured concrete at the hinge seat/bearing region."
      - "No direct evidence of bearing displacement, loss of support contact, or unseating."

  R2:
    label: "Open but inspection needed"
    cues:
      - "Minor localized cracking/spalling near joint edges without clear hinge seat/bearing distress."
      - "Debris in joint gap or joint seal damage that may affect movement, but no clear structural distress is visible."

  R3:
    label: "Close but inspection needed"
    cues:
      - "Bearing element appears shifted/rotated or seat contact appears compromised, but full unseating is not clearly confirmed."
      - "Noticeable relative displacement (vertical step/lateral shift/rotation) that appears inconsistent with intended hinge/joint configuration."
      - "Railing/barrier shows obvious misalignment/kink/drop across the joint consistent with deck movement."
      - "Expansion joint gap is unusally wide and the seal no longer fills the joint."

decision_rules:
  - "Classify based on the inspection photo only; reference images are for calibration."
  - "Do NOT infer 'reduced hinge seat length' or 'unseating risk' from designed geometry alone (half-joints/hinges may have intentional recesses/steps)."
  - "Escalate to R3 only when there is an obvious loss of bearing area (hinge seat failure) and hinge damage"
  
output:
  requirement: "Return only JSON. Keys: component_id, r_state, reason."
  reason_guidance:
    - "Reason must describe directly observable cues (e.g., no cracking/spalling at seat')."
    - "Avoid speculative mechanism language (e.g., 'reduced hinge seat length') unless directly visible (deck off seat, missing contact, broken seat concrete)."
