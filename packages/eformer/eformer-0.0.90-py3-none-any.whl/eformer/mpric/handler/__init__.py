"""Precision handler submodule for mixed precision operations.

This submodule provides the PrecisionHandler class, which serves as the main
interface for managing mixed precision training and inference in JAX.

The PrecisionHandler integrates precision policies with loss scaling to enable
efficient low-precision training while maintaining numerical stability.
