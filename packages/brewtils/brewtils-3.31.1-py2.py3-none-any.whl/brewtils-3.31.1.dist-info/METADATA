Brewtils
========

Brewtils is the Python library for interfacing with Beergarden systems. If you are planning on
writing beer-garden plugins, this is the correct library for you. In addition to writing plugins,
it provides simple ways to query the API and is officially supported by the beer-garden team.

Features
--------
Brewtils helps you interact with beer-garden.

* Easy way to create beer-garden plugins
* Full support of the entire Beer-Garden API
* Officially supported by the beer-garden team

Installation
------------

To install brewtils, run this command in your terminal:

```console
$ pip install brewtils
```
Or add it to your ``requirements.txt``

```console
$ cat brewtils >> requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Quick Start
-----------

You can create your own beer-garden plugins without much problem at all. To start, we'll create
the obligatory hello-world plugin. Creating a plugin is as simple as:

```python
from brewtils.decorators import system, parameter, command
from brewtils.plugin import RemotePlugin

@system
class HelloWorld(object):

    @parameter(key="message", description="The message to echo", type="String")
    def say_hello(self, message="World!"):
        print("Hello, %s!" % message)
        return "Hello, %s!" % message

if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = HelloWorld()
    plugin = RemotePlugin(client,
                            name="hello",
                            version="0.0.1",
                            bg_host='127.0.0.1',
                            bg_port=2337)
    plugin.run()
```
Assuming you have a Beer Garden running on port 2337 on localhost, running this will register and
start your plugin! You now have your first plugin running in beer-garden. Let's use another part
of the ``brewtils`` library to exercise your plugin from python.

The ``SystemClient`` is designed to help you interact with registered Systems as if they were native
Python objects.

```python
from brewtils.rest.system_client import SystemClient

hello_client = SystemClient('localhost', 2337, 'hello')

request = hello_client.say_hello(message="from system client")

print(request.status) # 'SUCCESS'
print(request.output) # Hello, from system client!
```

In the background, the ``SystemClient`` has executed an HTTP POST with the payload required to get
beer-garden to execute your command. The ``SystemClient`` is how most people interact with
beer-garden when they are in the context of python and want to be making requests.

Of course, the rest of the API is accessible through the ``brewtils`` package. The ``EasyClient``
provides simple convenient methods to call the API and auto-serialize the responses. Suppose you
want to get a list of all the commands on all systems:

```python
from brewtils.rest.easy_client import EasyClient

client = EasyClient('localhost', 2337)

systems = client.find_systems()

for system in systems:
    for command in system.commands:
        print(command.name)
```

This is just a small taste of what is possible with the ``EasyClient``. Feel free to explore all the
methods that are exposed.
