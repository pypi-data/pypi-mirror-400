### Fixed
- Fixed missing `Sources` enum export in package `__init__.py`

## [0.2.5] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- Added `source` field to `RawMeasurement` model for tracking data source origin
- New `Sources` enum in base models with values: sensorhub (1), chirpstack (2), supla (3)
- `source_enum` property for convenient access to Sources enum on RawMeasurement
- Database migration `e0d5bb6c3974_add_source_field_to_rawmeasurement.py` adds source column with default value sensorhub

## [0.2.4] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- Added `Alert` model for storing active and resolved alert instances
- Alert model features:
  - `active_marker` for tracking alert status (NULL for resolved, True for active)
  - `detected_ts` for when alert was first detected
  - `resolved_ts` for when alert was resolved
  - `details` JSON field for flexible alert data storage
  - Unique constraint ensuring one active alert per device/type/level combination
  - Foreign key relationship to `AlertDefinition`
- Removed `device_name` from `AlertBase`, moved to `AlertDefinition` model

### Changed
- Alembic migration files formatted with isort and black for consistent code style

## [0.2.3] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- Added `receivers` field to `AlertDefinition` model for storing alert notification recipients as JSON
- Database migration `314a5d69646a_add_receivers_to_alert_definition.py` adds the receivers column

## [0.2.2] - 2025-08-05

### Changed
- Removed unique constraint on `alert_definition` table for `tenant` and `meter_id` columns
- Database migration `90c1158cc2ba_delete_alert_uniqueness.py` removes the uniqueness constraint

## [0.2.1] - 2025-08-04

### Fixed
- Fixed missing imports: Added `AlertLevels` and `AlertTypes` to package exports

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-04

### Added
- Alert system models for IoT monitoring
- `AlertDefinition` model for defining alert rules with JSON properties
- `AlertBase` abstract base class with type, level, and device name fields
- New enum types for alert categorization:
  - `AlertTypes`: threshold_high, threshold_low, sudden_change, offline, data_gap, data_delayed, invalid_reading, stuck_value, noise
  - `AlertLevels`: emergency, critical, warning, info
- Database migration `0d7bea8f4d60_create_alerts_models.py` for alert_definition table

## [0.1.2] - 2025-07-31

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Restructured package layout from `models.*` to `iot_db.models.*`
- Updated import paths: use `from iot_db.models import WaterMeasurement` instead of `from models import WaterMeasurement`
- Updated Alembic configuration to work with new package structure

### Migration Guide
- Change imports from `from models import *` to `from iot_db.models import *`
- All model classes remain the same, only import paths have changed

## [0.1.1] - 2025-07-31

### Fixed
- Fixed package metadata configuration for PyPI compatibility
- Resolved license file inclusion issues

### Changed

  - TemperatureMeasurement model
  - RawMeasurement model for unprocessed data
- Alembic migrations support with existing migration history
- Multi-tenant support via tenant UUID field
- Type-safe enums for sensor types (electricity, water, heat, temperature)
