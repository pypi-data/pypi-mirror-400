### 🚨 Expert Challenge — Network Incident Timeline (Offline)

You are investigating a production outage.

You are given three log files:

- `firewall.log`
- `dns.log`
- `app.log`

Your task:

1. Correlate events across all logs
2. Reconstruct the incident timeline
3. Write a script named `timeline.sh` that outputs **exactly**:

10:01 DNS failure detected
10:02 Firewall rule change applied
10:03 Application outage occurred

⚠️ Rules:
- Do NOT run live network commands
- Do NOT modify system settings
- Only analyze provided logs
- Output must match exactly (order and wording)

🎯 Goal:
Demonstrate expert-level incident correlation and reasoning.
