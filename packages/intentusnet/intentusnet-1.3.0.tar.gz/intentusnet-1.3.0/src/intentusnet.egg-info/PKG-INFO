# IntentusNet

### Deterministic Execution Runtime for Intent Routing and Multi-Agent Systems

**Deterministic • Transport-Agnostic • EMCL-Ready • MCP-Compatible**

IntentusNet is an open-source, language-agnostic **execution runtime for multi-agent systems**.  
It makes routing, fallback, and failure handling **deterministic, replayable, explainable, and production-operable**.

IntentusNet focuses strictly on **execution semantics**, not planning or intelligence — ensuring that **execution behavior remains predictable even when models are not**.

[![Architecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/architecture-execution--runtime-orange)](#)

---

## Why IntentusNet

Modern LLM systems are observable, but **not debuggable**.

In real production systems, failures are often:

- irreproducible
- incorrectly blamed on models
- hidden behind retries and fallback logic
- impossible to replay or audit

IntentusNet addresses this by enforcing **deterministic execution semantics around LLMs**, so failures become:

- **Replayable**
- **Attributable**
- **Explainable**

---

## Execution Recording & Deterministic Replay

IntentusNet treats **executions as immutable facts**, not transient logs.

Each execution is:

- recorded as a first-class artifact
- replayable deterministically (without re-running models)
- inspectable after crashes or upgrades

This enables:

- reliable root-cause analysis
- auditability and compliance
- safe model iteration without rewriting history

> **The model may change.  
> The execution must not.**

This design is formalized in  
**RFC-0001 — Debuggable Execution Semantics for LLM Systems**  
→ `rfcs/RFC-0001-debuggable-llm-execution.md`

**Non-goals:** IntentusNet does not plan tasks, reason about goals, or optimize prompts.

---

## Core Capabilities

- Deterministic intent routing
- Explicit fallback chains
- Execution recording (WAL-backed)
- Deterministic replay & verification
- Crash-safe recovery
- Typed failures & execution contracts
- Operator-grade CLI
- Transport-agnostic execution

---

## Intent-Oriented Routing

- Capability-driven routing
- Explicit fallback sequences
- Sequential or parallel execution
- Priority-based routing
- Auditable routing decisions
- Trace spans with execution metadata

Routing decisions are **deterministic and replayable**, not heuristic.

---

## EMCL Secure Envelope (Optional)

IntentusNet supports **EMCL (Encrypted Model Context Layer)**:

- AES-GCM authenticated encryption
- HMAC-SHA256 signing (demo provider)
- Identity-chain propagation
- Anti-replay protections

EMCL is optional and transport-agnostic.

---

## MCP Compatibility

IntentusNet is **MCP-compatible by design**:

- Agents can be wrapped as MCP tools
- MCP tool requests can be accepted
- MCP-style responses can be emitted
- Optional EMCL-secured MCP envelopes

IntentusNet provides deterministic execution semantics **around MCP tools**.

---

## Language-Agnostic Design

Agents can be implemented in any language that supports:

- HTTP / JSON
- ZeroMQ
- WebSocket

Including:
Python, C#, Go, TypeScript, Rust

---

## SDK Status

### Included — Python Runtime SDK

- Intent router & fallback engine
- Agent base classes
- Agent registry
- Multi-transport execution
- Execution recorder & replay engine
- WAL-backed crash recovery
- EMCL providers
- MCP adapter
- CLI tooling
- Example agents & demos

> **Note:**  
> Higher-level ergonomic SDKs (decorators, auto-registration) and C#/TypeScript SDKs are planned next.

---

## Demos

### `deterministic_routing_demo`

Compares three approaches using identical capabilities:

- **without** — ad-hoc production glue code
- **with** — deterministic routing via IntentusNet
- **mcp** — routing backed by a mock MCP tool server

```bash
python -m examples.deterministic_routing_demo.demo --mode without
python -m examples.deterministic_routing_demo.demo --mode with
python -m examples.deterministic_routing_demo.demo --mode mcp
```

### `execution_replay_example`

Shows how model upgrades change live behavior while past executions remain replayable.

---

## Operational Scope (Important)

IntentusNet is a **deterministic execution runtime**, not an autonomous agent system.

### Guarantees

- Deterministic routing, fallback, and failures
- Crash-safe execution recording
- Deterministic replay or loud failure on divergence
- Explicit contracts and typed failures
- CLI-first operational control

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No task planning or reasoning
- No evaluation of model outputs
- No replacement for workflow engines
- No distributed consensus in v1

### Determinism Boundary

Determinism is enforced at the **execution layer**, not the **model layer**.  
Non-deterministic model behavior is detected, recorded, and surfaced — never hidden.

---

## Roadmap

**Next**

- Python ergonomic SDK
- C# SDK
- TypeScript SDK
- MCP adapter improvements
- EMCL key rotation

**Future (Optional)**

- Multi-agent planning layer (research)
- Trust-scored routing
