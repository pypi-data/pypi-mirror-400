# git-fzf-more
git-fzf is great. I use `git iadd` all the time to add more things. It's so good I want more commands so I am putting these here. 

I encourage the author of git-fzf to steal all the features here. But I am lazy and jaded with pull requrests and just want to vibe code this so I am just dumping this here.

# Installation
pipx install git-fzf-more

git irm -- remove an untracked files. By default remove untracked files.
