    "This notebook demonstrates how checkpoint selection can be done when running the LAB training methodology through training hub. \n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpoint selection is an optional step at the end of an LLM training run, often used to maximize how much you get out of your training run.\n",
    "When customizing a model using the LAB methodology, the resulting checkpoints may not differ greatly on their domain-knowledge, but may vary in their performance on general domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how you can use a complex benchmark such as OpenLLM Leaderboard v2 to select the most optimal checkpoint out of your training run.\n",

    "### Why Evaluation Matters for Custom Instruction-Tuned Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When fine-tuning instruction-following models with the LAB methodology, we mix the base model's original instruction data with our custom domain-specific data. This data mixing creates an important challenge: while we want the model to excel at our specific tasks, we also need to ensure it maintains its general-purpose capabilities as an intelligent chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process can create subtle trade-offs:\n",
    "- Early checkpoints might retain more general capabilities but have less domain expertise\n",
    "- Later checkpoints might excel at your specific tasks but potentially degrade on general tasks\n",
    "- Different checkpoints may balance these capabilities differently\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why evaluating checkpoints across diverse, complex domains is crucial - we need to find the checkpoint that best balances domain-specific performance with general intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenLLM Leaderboard v2: An Ideal Evaluation Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenLLM Leaderboard v2 is particularly well-suited for checkpoint selection because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: It tests multiple facets of intelligence including reasoning (GPQA, MuSR), math (MATH), instruction following (IFEval), and general knowledge (MMLU-Pro)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Challenging Tasks**: These benchmarks are designed to be difficult, helping distinguish between checkpoints that might perform similarly on easier tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real-World Relevance**: The tasks mirror the diverse queries a chatbot encounters in production, from technical questions to creative problem-solving\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Standardized Metrics**: Provides consistent, comparable scores across checkpoints, making selection objective rather than subjective\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating all checkpoints from your training run on this benchmark, you can identify which checkpoint best preserves the model's versatility while incorporating your custom knowledge - ensuring you deploy the most capable version of your fine-tuned model.\n"

    "Although it's possible to run this same script directly through via lm-eval-harness, it comes with the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex output**: The leaderboard scores returned from `lm-eval` are complex and require post-processing to obtain a score that's easy to read.\n",
    "2. **Difficult to optimize**: Without the correct configuration, leaderboard can take an hour and a half to run on an **8xH100** machine. But obtaining the correct configuration requires an engineering effort to work properly. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **LAB Training**: Executed two-phase training with knowledge tuning (Phase07) followed by skills + replay training (Phase10)\n",
    "2. **Checkpoint Collection**: Gathered all checkpoints from both training phases\n",
    "3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Used OpenLLM Leaderboard v2 to evaluate each checkpoint across multiple intelligence dimensions\n",
    "4. **Optimal Selection**: Identified the best-performing checkpoint based on overall scores\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trade-offs Matter**: Different checkpoints excel at different tasks - the best checkpoint balances general intelligence with your domain expertise\n",
    "- **Evaluation is Essential**: Without proper evaluation, you might deploy a suboptimal checkpoint that underperforms on important capabilities\n",
    "- **Leaderboard v2 Efficiency**: With proper configuration, evaluation takes only ~15 minutes per checkpoint instead of 90+ minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deploy Your Best Model**: Use the identified best checkpoint for inference or further fine-tuning\n",
    "2. **Domain-Specific Testing**: Additionally test the best checkpoint on your specific use cases\n",
    "3. **Consider Task-Specific Selection**: If certain tasks are more important for your application, you might weight those scores higher in selection\n",
    "4. **Monitor in Production**: Continue evaluating model performance on real-world tasks after deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Evaluation Options\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook uses OpenLLM Leaderboard v2, you can adapt the same workflow with other evaluation frameworks:\n",
    "- **lm-evaluation-harness**: For custom task suites\n",
    "- **OpenCompass**: For comprehensive Chinese language evaluation\n",
    "- **Your Custom Benchmarks**: For domain-specific evaluation needs\n",
