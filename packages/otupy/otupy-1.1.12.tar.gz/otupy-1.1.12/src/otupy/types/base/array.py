			Each field has a position, label, and type.
			However, position does not matter in this implementation.*

		Array can be initialized with both a list, an Array, or a scalar. In the last case, an Array with
		a single value is created. Note that this overrides the typical behaviour of `list` (for
		instance, a `str` is not converted to an `list` of characters). 

		Derived classes must provide a :py:attr:`~otupy.types.base.array.Array.fieldtypes` 
		dictionary that associate each field name
		to its class. This is strictly required in order to instantiate the object at
		deserialization time. However, no check is performed when new items are inserted.
