# Stream Tab Hardware Testing Checklist

**Quick testing guide for Marlin hardware integration**  
**Prerequisites:** Marlin machine connected via USB, FiberPath GUI running

---

## Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Connect Hardware:**

   - Plug Marlin machine into USB port
   - Power on machine
   - Note port name (COM3, /dev/ttyUSB0, etc.)

2. **Prepare Test Files:**

   ```gcode
   ; test_small.gcode (save to desktop)
   G28 ; Home
   G90 ; Absolute
   G1 X10 Y10 Z5 F3000
   G1 X20 Y20
   G1 X10 Y10
   M400 ; Wait
   M18 ; Disable motors
   ```

3. **Launch GUI:**
   - Run `npm run tauri dev` in fiberpath_gui
   - Navigate to Stream tab (Alt+2)

## Critical Tests (15 minutes)

### 1. Connection (3 min)

- [ ] **Refresh Ports** → See your port listed?
- [ ] **Select port** → Choose your COM/tty port
- [ ] **Connect** → Green indicator, success toast?
- [ ] **Check log** → Connection message visible?

**Expected:** Green "Connected" status, toast notification, log entry

### 2. Manual Commands (5 min)

- [ ] **M114** (Get Position) → Response in log?
- [ ] **G28** (Home) → Machine homes, "Homing complete" toast?
- [ ] **M114** again → New position shown?
- [ ] **Type `M114`** in input → Press Enter → Works?
- [ ] **M112** (E-Stop) → Machine stops, warning toast?

**Expected:** Blue command entries, green response entries, appropriate toasts

### 3. File Streaming (7 min)

- [ ] **Select File** → Pick test_small.gcode → Filename toast?
- [ ] **Start Stream** → Progress bar updates?
- [ ] **Watch log** → Commands appear every 10th line?
- [ ] **Machine executes** → Actually moves?
- [ ] **Completion** → Success toast with count?

**Expected:** Smooth progress updates, machine executes all commands, completion toast

---

## Additional Tests (15 minutes)

### 4. Error Handling (5 min)

- [ ] **Invalid command** → Type `BADCMD` → Error in log/toast?
- [ ] **Disconnect mid-stream** → Unplug USB → Error toast?
- [ ] **Try command while disconnected** → Section disabled?

### 5. Pause/Resume (5 min)

- [ ] **Stream test_small.gcode**
- [ ] **Click Pause** → Machine stops, warning toast?
- [ ] **Click Resume** → Machine continues, success toast?
- [ ] **Completes** → Success?
- [ ] **Test large file** → Stream test_medium.gcode (1000+ commands)
- [ ] **Pause mid-stream** → Verify machine stops executing
- [ ] **Resume** → Verify streaming continues from pause point
- [ ] **Complete** → Verify all commands executed successfully

### 6. Tab Navigation (5 min)

- [ ] **Connect** → Switch to Main tab → Switch back → Still connected?
- [ ] **Start stream** → Switch to Main tab → Switch back → Still streaming?
- [ ] **Check progress** → Updates correctly?

## Quick Issue Checklist

If something doesn't work, check:

**No ports listed:**

- Is machine powered on?
- Is USB cable connected?
- Try different USB port
- Click Refresh Ports

**Connection fails:**

- Is another program using the port? (Arduino IDE, Pronterface, etc.)
- Try different baud rate (115200 vs 250000)
- Check machine firmware responds to serial commands

**Commands don't execute:**

- Is machine actually connected? (Green indicator?)
- Check log for responses
- Try simpler command (M114)

**Streaming fails:**

- Is file valid G-code?
- Try smaller test file first
- Check log for specific error
