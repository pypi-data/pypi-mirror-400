    registering photons by an image sensor. This operator simulates the data
    acquisition process where each event increases the output value by
    `factor` and the input tensor contains the expected values of corresponding
    output points. For example, a `factor` of 0.1 means that 10 events are
    needed to increase the output value by 1, while a factor of 10 means that
    a single event increases the output by 10. The output values are quantized
    to multiples of `factor`. The larger the factor, the more noise is present in
    the output. A factor of 0 makes this an identity operation.
