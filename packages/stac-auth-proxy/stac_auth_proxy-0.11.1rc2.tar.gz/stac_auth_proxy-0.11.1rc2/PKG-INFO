STAC Auth Proxy is a proxy API that mediates between the client and your internally accessible STAC API to provide flexible authentication, authorization, and content-filtering mechanisms.

## ✨Features✨

- **🔐 Authentication:** Apply [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) token validation and optional scope checks to specified endpoints and methods
- **🛂 Content Filtering:** Use CQL2 filters via the [Filter Extension](https://github.com/stac-api-extensions/filter?tab=readme-ov-file) to tailor API responses based on request context (e.g. user role)
- **🤝 External Policy Integration:** Integrate with external systems (e.g. [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)) to generate CQL2 filters dynamically from policy decisions
- **🧩 Authentication Extension:** Add the [Authentication Extension](https://github.com/stac-extensions/authentication) to API responses to expose auth-related metadata
- **📘 OpenAPI Augmentation:** Enhance the [OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/specification/) with security details to keep auto-generated docs and UIs (e.g., [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)) accurate
- **🗜️ Response Compression:** Optimize response sizes using [`starlette-cramjam`](https://github.com/developmentseed/starlette-cramjam/)
