## The name of the docker network that containers will be attached to.
## If you want to proxy Packit to the host, you will need to
## arrange a proxy on this network, or use dev_mode in the web section
## below.
## Prefix for container names; we'll use {container_prefix}-(container_name)
container_prefix: packit

## Set this flag to true to prevent use of --volumes in the cli to remove
## volumes on stop
protect_data: false

## Docker org for images
repo: ghcr.io/mrc-ide

## outpack: stores the outpack metadata
## proxy_logs: stores logs from the reverse proxy (only used if proxy is given)
## (More volumes are anticipated as the tool develops)
