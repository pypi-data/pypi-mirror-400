onvif-gui
===

Onvif GUI is an integrated camera management and NVR system with an intuitive user interface that can easily manage a fleet of cameras and create high resolution recordings based on alarm conditions. A best of breed YOLO detector is included with the system to facilitate accurate alarm signals without false detections. The system is designed to scale with available hardware and will run on simple configurations with minimal hardware requirements as well as high end multi core CPUs with NVIDIA GPU for maximum performance. The system can be configured with auto start settings and a user friendly icon so that non-technical users can feel comfortable working with the application without specialized training. File management is easy with an automated disk space manager and file playback controls.

Please note that installation of this program may require some dependencies.
