In this tutorial we will see how to read a PDF using our custom component, which is based on **PDFPlumber**. Then, we will connect this reader component into Visual Language Models to extract text or get annotations from images inside the PDF. In addition, we will explore which options we have to analyze and extract the content of the PDF in a custom, fast and comprehensive way. Let's dive in.

!!! note
Remember that you can access the complete documentation of this Reader Component in the [**Developer Guide**](../../api_reference/reader.md#vanillareader).

## How to connect a VLM to VanillaReader

For this tutorial, we will use the same data as the first tutorial. [**Consult reference here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR/refs/heads/main/data/sample_pdf.pdf).

To extract image descriptions or perform OCR, instantiate any model that implements the [`BaseModel` interface](../../api_reference/model.md#basevisionmodel) (vision variants inherit from it) and pass it into the `VanillaReader`. Swapping providers only changes the model constructor; your Reader usage remains the same.

### Supported models (and when to use them)

| Model (docs)                                                                    | When to use                                       | Required environment variables                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`OpenAIVisionModel`](../../api_reference/model.md#openaivisionmodel)           | You have an OpenAI API key and want OpenAI cloud. | `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional: `OPENAI_MODEL`, defaults to `gpt-4o`)                                                     |
| [`AzureOpenAIVisionModel`](../../api_reference/model.md#azureopenaivisionmodel) | You use Azure OpenAI Service.                     | `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`                |
| [`GrokVisionModel`](../../api_reference/model.md#grokvisionmodel)               | You have access to xAI Grok multimodal.           | `XAI_API_KEY` (optional: `XAI_MODEL`, default `grok-4`)                                                               |
| [`GeminiVisionModel`](../../api_reference/model.md#geminivisionmodel)           | You want Google’s Gemini vision models.           | `GEMINI_API_KEY` (also install extras: `pip install "splitter-mr[multimodal]"`)                                       |
| [`AnthropicVisionModel`](../../api_reference/model.md#anthropicvisionmodel)     | You have an Anthropic key (Claude Vision).        | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional: `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`)                                                                     |
| [`HuggingFaceVisionModel`](../../api_reference/model.md#huggingfacevisionmodel) | You prefer local/open-source/offline inference.   | Install extras: `pip install "splitter-mr[multimodal]"` (optional: `HF_ACCESS_TOKEN` if the chosen model requires it) |

> **Note on HuggingFace models:** Not all HF models are supported (e.g., gated or uncommon architectures). A well-tested option is **SmolDocling**.

  <h4>OpenAI</h4>

```python
from splitter_mr.model import OpenAIVisionModel

# Reads OPENAI_API_KEY (and optional OPENAI_MODEL) from .env if present

# or:
# model = AzureOpenAIVisionModel(
#     api_key="...",

#     api_version="2024-02-15-preview",
#     azure_deployment="<your-deployment-name>",
# )
```

  <h4>xAI Grok</h4>

# Reads XAI_API_KEY (and optional XAI_MODEL) from .env
model = GrokVisionModel()
```

  <h4>Google Gemini</h4>

```

  <h4>Hugging Face (local/open-source)</h4>

```python
from splitter_mr.model import HuggingFaceVisionModel

# Token only if the model requires gating
model = HuggingFaceVisionModel()
```

</details>



```python
from splitter_mr.model import AzureOpenAIVisionModel

model = AzureOpenAIVisionModel()
```


Then, use the Reader component and insert the model as parameter:


```python
from splitter_mr.reader import VanillaReader

reader = VanillaReader(model=model)
```


Then, you can read the file. The result will be an object from the type `ReaderOutput`, which is a dictionary containing some metadata about the file. To get the content, you can access to the `text` attribute:


```python
file = "data/sample_pdf.pdf"

output = reader.read(file_path=file)
print(output.text)
```

    Converting PDF files to other formats, such as Markdown, is a surprisingly
    complex task due to the nature of the PDF format itself. PDF (Portable
    Document Format) was designed primarily for preserving the visual layout of
    documents, making them look the same across different devices and
    platforms. However, this design goal introduces several challenges when trying to
    extract and convert the underlying content into a more flexible, structured format
    like Markdown.

    conversion tools must blend text extraction, document analysis, and sometimes
    machine learning techniques (such as OCR or structure recognition) to produce
    usable, readable, and faithful Markdown output. As a result, perfect conversion
    is rarely possible, and manual review and cleanup are often required.

As observed, all the images have been described by the LLM.


## Experimenting with some keyword arguments

Suppose that you need to simply get the base64 images from the file. Then, you can use the option `show_base64_images` to get those images:


```python
reader = VanillaReader()
output = reader.read(file_path=file, show_base64_images=True)
print(output.text)
```

In addition, you can modify how the image and page placeholders are generated with the options `image_placeholder` and `page_placeholder`. *Note that in this case we are not using any VLM*.


```python
reader = VanillaReader()
output = reader.read(
    file_path=file, image_placeholder="## Image", page_placeholder="## Page"
)
print(output.text)
```

    Conclusion
    While it may seem simple on the surface, converting PDFs to formats like
    Markdown involves a series of technical and interpretive challenges. Effective
    conversion tools must blend text extraction, document analysis, and sometimes
    machine learning techniques (such as OCR or structure recognition) to produce
    usable, readable, and faithful Markdown output. As a result, perfect conversion
    is rarely possible, and manual review and cleanup are often required.

But one of the most important features is to scan the PDF as PageImages, to analyze every page with a VLM to extract the content. In order to do that, you can simply activate the option `scan_pdf_pages`. 


```python
reader = VanillaReader(model=model)
output = reader.read(file_path=file, scan_pdf_pages=True)
print(output.text)
```

Remember that you can always customize the prompt to get one or other results using the parameter `prompt`:


```python
reader = VanillaReader(model=model)
output = reader.read(
    file_path=file, prompt="Extract the content of this resource in html format"
)
print(output.text)
```

To sum up, we can see that `VanillaReader` is a good option to extract rapidly and efficiently the text content for a PDF file. Remember that you can customize how the extraction is performed. But remember to consult other reading options in the [Developer guide](../../api_reference/reader.md) or [other tutorials](../examples.md).

Thank you so much for reading :).
