    The free boundary minimum surface problem.

    The problem comes from the discretization of the minimum surface
    problem on the unit square with "free boundary conditions"
    one must find the minumum surface over the unit square
    (which is clearly 1.0). Furthermore, the average distance of the surface
    from zero is also minimized.

    The Hessian is dense.

    The unit square is discretized into (p-1)**2 little squares. The
    heights of the considered surface above the corners of these little
    squares are the problem variables, There are p**2 of them.
    Given these heights, the area above a little square is
    approximated by the
      S(i,j) = sqrt( 1 + 0.5(p-1)**2 ( a(i,j) + b(i,j) ) ) / (p-1)**2
    where
      a(i,j) = x(i,j) - x(i+1,j+1)
    and
      b(i,j) = x(i+1,j) - x(i,j+1)
