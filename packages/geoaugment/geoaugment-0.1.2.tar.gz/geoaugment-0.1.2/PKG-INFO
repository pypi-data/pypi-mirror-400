# **GeoAugment**

**GeoAugment** is a **constraint-aware synthetic geospatial data generation engine** designed to address **data scarcity in GeoAI**, particularly in **flood risk analysis**, **urban systems**, and **environmental modeling** in data-limited regions.

It generates physically plausible synthetic labels and features from limited geospatial inputs (e.g., DEMs), enabling robust training of downstream Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models.

GeoAugment does **not** train machine learning models.  
GeoAugment **creates high-quality synthetic training data** that can later be used by ML or DL frameworks such as **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, or **scikit-learn**.

---

## **Why GeoAugment Exists**

In many regions (especially across the Global South):

- Labeled flood-risk maps do not exist
- Historical flood records are incomplete
- Satellite imagery is noisy, cloudy, or sparse
- Urban layouts differ significantly from Global North datasets
- Ground truth data is expensive or unavailable
- ML/DL models fail due to label scarcity, not model weakness

Most GeoAI pipelines silently assume that **clean labels already exist**.  
GeoAugment exists to solve that upstream problem.

---

## **What GeoAugment Is (and Is Not)**

### **GeoAugment IS**
- A **synthetic data generator**
- A **data augmentation engine**
- A **pre-training / pre-modeling tool**
- A **CLI + Python library**
- Domain-aware and physically constrained

### **GeoAugment IS NOT**
- A flood prediction model
- A neural network
- An end-to-end ML system
- A replacement for PyTorch or TensorFlow

GeoAugment **stops at data generation**.

---

## **Core Concepts (Critical Definitions)**

This section defines **every major technical term** used in GeoAugment.

---

### **Synthetic Data**

*Artificially generated data* that statistically and structurally resembles real-world data.

**In GeoAugment**:
- Synthetic data represents **flood risk**, **susceptibility**, or **potential**
- Generated from real geospatial inputs (e.g. DEMs)
- Used as training labels for ML models

---

### **Flood Risk (Continuous)**

A **continuous surface** representing relative likelihood or severity of flooding.

- Values typically in `[0, 1]`
- `0` = very low risk  
- `1` = very high risk  

GeoAugment **always generates continuous flood risk first**.

Binary flood maps are optional and derived later.

---

### **Perturbation**

A *controlled modification* applied to data to introduce variability.

**In GeoAugment**:
- Perturbation simulates **uncertainty** and **natural variability**
- Examples:
  - Slight elevation noise
  - Spatial variation in water accumulation
  - Random but constrained flood potential changes

Perturbations are **never random noise alone** — they are constrained.

---

### **Latent Field**

An **internal, hidden spatial field** that represents flood-driving forces.

Think of it as:
> “Flood potential before we observe it.”

Examples:
- Accumulation tendency
- Drainage inefficiency
- Subsurface water pressure

Latent fields are later **constrained and calibrated** into usable flood risk.

---

### **Spatial Scale**

The **characteristic size of spatial patterns**, measured in pixels.

- Small scale → noisy, localized patterns
- Large scale → smooth, broad flood zones

Used to ensure realism:
- Floods are spatially coherent
- No pixel-level randomness

---

### **Constraint**

A **rule that synthetic data must obey**.

GeoAugment enforces:
- Physical constraints (e.g. water flows downhill)
- Statistical constraints (e.g. bounded risk values)
- Spatial constraints (e.g. smoothness)

Constraints prevent hallucinated or impossible outputs.

---

### **Downhill Bias**

A constraint that **increases flood risk at lower elevations**.

Without this:
- High elevations might appear flood-prone
- Outputs become physically implausible

---

### **Calibration**

The process of **normalizing and scaling** synthetic outputs.

Example:
- Mapping raw flood potential to `[0, 1]`
- Aligning outputs to a percentile (e.g. top 10% = high risk)

Calibration makes outputs **ML-ready**.

---

### **Tile-Based Dataset Generation**

Large rasters are split into **fixed-size tiles** for ML training.

Benefits:
- GPU compatibility
- Memory efficiency
- Standard ML input sizes

GeoAugment supports overlap to reduce edge artifacts.

---

### **Dry-Run Mode**

A **validation-only execution** mode.

When enabled:
- YAML config is loaded
- All parameters are validated
- No data is read
- No computation is performed

Used for:
- Debugging configs
- CI pipelines
- Safe experimentation

---

### **YAML Configuration**

A human-readable file format for defining parameters.

Why YAML:
- Versionable
- Shareable
- Reproducible
- Safer than long CLI commands

---

## **Flood Synthesis Pipeline (High-Level)**

GeoAugment flood generation follows **four explicit stages**:

1. **Latent Field Generation**
2. **Constraint Enforcement**
3. **Calibration**
4. **Dataset Export**

Each stage is modular and inspectable.

---

## Tile-Based Dataset Generation

Large rasters are split into fixed-size overlapping tiles to:

- Fit ML/DL input requirements

- Increase dataset size

- Preserve spatial locality
