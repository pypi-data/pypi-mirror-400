Python SDK providing core utilities and cloud provider integrations for Baresquare services.

## Documentation

- **[User Guide](docs/users.md)** - Installation and configuration of the SDK
- **[Examples](examples/README.md)** - Usage examples
- **[Developer Guide](docs/devs.md)** - Setup, development, and publishing

## Design Decisions

- **Single-package approach**: One `pyproject.toml` with unified versioning across all modules
- **Optional dependencies**: Users install only what they need via extras (base, AWS, development)
- **Modular imports**: Clear separation between core utilities and cloud provider integrations
- **PyPI publishing**: Publicly available package with automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions
