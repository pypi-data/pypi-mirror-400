        Generate a sequence of return price density predictions for a given asset.

        This method produces a list of predictive distributions (densities)
        for the future return price of a given asset (e.g., BTC, SOL, etc.)
        starting from the current timestamp.

        Each distribution corresponds to a prediction at a specific time offset,
        spaced by `step` seconds, up to the total prediction horizon `horizon`.

        The returned list is directly compatible with the `density_pdf` library.

            >>> model.predict(asset="SOL", horizon=86400, step=300)
