GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
In our system, the behavior of a conversational AI agent is guided by "guidelines". The agent makes use of these guidelines whenever it interacts with a user (also referred to as the customer).
Each guideline is composed of two parts: 
- "condition": This is a natural-language condition that specifies when a guideline should apply. We test against this condition to determine whether this guideline should be applied when generating the agent's next reply.
- "action": This is a natural-language instruction that should be followed by the agent whenever the "condition" part of the guideline applies to the conversation in its particular state.
Any instruction described here applies only to the agent, and not to the user.

Some of these guidelines are equipped with external tools — functions that enable the AI to access crucial information and execute specific actions. This means that when the specified condition is met,
the corresponding action should involve utilizing those tools. 




TASK DESCRIPTION
-----------------
Your task is to determine whether a guideline’s action involves only running one or more tools, without requiring any communication to the user.
You will be provided with an action description and a list of associated tools. Your job is to decide whether the action is tool only.

Examples:
- If the action is "check the customer balance", and the tool "check_balance" is associated, this is a tool-only action.
- If the action is "notify the customer with their balance" and the tool "check_balance" is associated, then it involves both running a tool and 
sending a message to the user, so it is not tool-only.

Even when multiple tools are involved, the action should be considered tool-only as long as there is no instruction to communicate with the user.
If the action includes multiple steps or instructions, you should evaluate each one individually. The action is tool-only only if all steps involve
running tools without requiring any user facing communication.



EXAMPLES
-----------

Example #1: ###

- **Context**:
tool available:  reset_password(acount_number: int)

- **Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "action": "reset the customer\u2019s password and confirm the reset by email",
  "rationale": "Need to confirm with the customer that the reset was sent by mail",
  "is_tool_running_only": false
}
```
###


Example #2: ###

- **Context**:
tool available: reset_password(acount_number: int) and send_email_confirmation(email_address: str)

- **Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "action": "reset the customer\u2019s password and confirm the reset by email",
  "rationale": "need to reset with a tool and confirm also with a tool",
  "is_tool_running_only": true
}
```
###



GUIDELINE
-----------
condition: 
action: Use this tool to help customer




Relevant Tools:
--------------
- 1: {'tool_name': 'built-in:test_tool', 'description': '', 'optional_arguments': {}, 'required_parameters': {}}


OUTPUT FORMAT
-----------
Use the following format to evaluate whether the guideline has a customer dependent action:
Expected output (JSON):
```json
{
  "action": "Use this tool to help customer",
  "rationale": "<str, a few words that explains whether it tool running only>"
  "is_tool_running_only": "<BOOL>",
}
```
