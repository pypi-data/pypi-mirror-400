# pympostor

CLI impostor game with AI - A word deduction game where players must identify the impostor among them.

## Description

"Adivina El Impostor" (Guess the Impostor) is a word-based deduction game where participants must figure out who the impostor is among them. It's a game of strategy and deduction that requires skill to give clues without being too obvious.

## Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install pympostor
```

Or using uv:

```bash
uv pip install pympostor
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher
- OpenAI API key (set in your environment or `.env` file)

## Usage

After installation, run the game with:

```bash
pympostor play
```

You can customize the number of players and impostors:

```bash
pympostor play --jugadores 5 --impostores 1
```

Options:
- `--jugadores, -j`: Total number of players (minimum 3)
- `--impostores, -i`: Number of impostors (must be less than players/2)

## How It Works

- Most players receive the same secret keyword
- One or more impostors only know the category of the keyword, not the word itself
- Players take turns saying a word related to the keyword
- Players vote to eliminate who they think is the impostor
- The game continues until the impostor is found or wins
