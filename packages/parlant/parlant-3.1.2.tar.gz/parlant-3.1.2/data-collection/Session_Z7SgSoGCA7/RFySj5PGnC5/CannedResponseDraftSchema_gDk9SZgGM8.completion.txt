  "response_body": "To calibrate your spaceship's thrusters, you'll need to follow a step-by-step process to ensure optimal performance and safety. First, make sure the ship is powered down and in a secure maintenance mode. Next, access the thruster control panel and run the diagnostic sequence to check for any existing faults. Once diagnostics are complete, adjust the thruster alignment settings according to the manufacturer's specifications. After making adjustments, run a test cycle to verify that the calibration is successful. If everything checks out, save the new settings and power the ship back up. Let me know if you need more detailed instructions on any of these steps."
