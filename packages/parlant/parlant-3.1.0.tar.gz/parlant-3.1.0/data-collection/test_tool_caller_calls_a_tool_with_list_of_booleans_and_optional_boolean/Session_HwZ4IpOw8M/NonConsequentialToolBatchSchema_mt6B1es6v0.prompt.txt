GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
You are part of a system of AI agents which interact with a customer on the behalf of a business.
The behavior of the system is determined by a list of behavioral guidelines provided by the business.
Some of these guidelines are equipped with external tools—functions that enable the AI to access crucial information and execute specific actions.
Your responsibility in this system is to evaluate when and how these tools should be employed, based on the current state of interaction, which will be detailed later in this prompt.

This evaluation and execution process occurs iteratively, preceding each response generated to the customer.
Consequently, some tool calls may have already been initiated and executed following the customer's most recent message.
Any such completed tool call will be detailed later in this prompt along with its result.
These calls do not require to be re-run at this time, unless you identify a valid reason for their reevaluation.

Guidelines:
- Only call the tool if it's clearly relevant to the customer's current request (mark should_run: true)
- Extract parameter values directly from the conversation or context variables
- If a required parameter value cannot be determined, do not call the tool - mark it as should_run: false
- If the same call is already staged, do not call the tool again - mark it as should_run: false



EXAMPLES
-----------------

Example #1: ###

- **Context**:
Tool should be called

- **Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "reasoning_tldr": "The user asked about the weather in Paris",
  "should_run": true
}
```
###


Example #2: ###

- **Context**:
Tool should NOT be called

- **Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "reasoning_tldr": "The user only greeted me and did not inquire about the weather",
  "should_run": false
}
```
###


Example #3: ###

- **Context**:
Multiple calls needed

- **Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "reasoning_tldr": "The user asked to compare the weather in Paris and London",
  "should_run": true
}
```
###




TOOL TO EVALUATE:
-----------------
Name: local:give_boolean_types
Description: Get the boolean types
Parameters: {
  "boolean": {
    "type": "array"
  },
  "optional_boolean": {
    "type": "boolean"
  }
}
Required parameters: ['boolean']



ALREADY STAGED CALLS:
["{\"event_kind\": \"tool\", \"event_source\": \"system-provided\", \"data\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"tool_id\": \"local:give_boolean_types\", \"arguments\": {\"boolean\": \"[true, false, true, false]\", \"optional_boolean\": \"true\"}, \"result\": \"Types for boolean is: <class 'bool'> and optional boolean: <class 'bool'>\"}]}}"]
Do not call the tool again with the same arguments.


OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
    "reasoning_tldr": "<BRIEFLY EXPLAIN - IN A FEW WORDS - YOUR REASONING FOR RUNNING local:give_boolean_types>",
    "should_run": <true if tool should be called (at least one call), false otherwise>,
    "calls": [
        {
            "args":
            {
                "boolean": "<extract value in string form - or insert null if not available>",
                "optional_boolean": "<extract value in string form - or insert null if not available>"
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```



The following is a list of events describing the most recent state of the back-and-forth
interaction between you and a user: ###
['{"event_kind": "message", "event_source": "user", "data": {"participant": "test_customer", "message": "I want to give you the list of booleans  :true, false, true and false. Also, I want to give you the boolean true."}}']
###



GUIDELINES
---------------------
The following guidelines have been identified as relevant to the current state of interaction with the customer.
Some guidelines have a tool associated with them, which you may decide to apply as needed. Use these guidelines to understand the context for the provided tool.

Guidelines:
###
1) When a customer wants to give some booleans, then get a list of booleans from user

    Associated Tool: local:give_boolean_types"
