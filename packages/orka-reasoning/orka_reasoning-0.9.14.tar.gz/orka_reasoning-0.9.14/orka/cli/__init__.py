"""
OrKa CLI Package
===============

Modular CLI architecture with backward compatibility.

This package provides a clean modular structure for the OrKa CLI while maintaining
100% backward compatibility with existing code. All functions that were previously
available in `orka.orka_cli` are now properly organized into focused modules but
remain accessible through the same import patterns.

Architecture Overview
--------------------

**Core Modules:**
- `types` - Type definitions for events and payloads
- `core` - Core functionality including run_cli_entrypoint
- `utils` - Shared utilities like setup_logging
- `parser` - Command-line argument parsing logic

**Command Modules:**
- `memory/` - Memory management commands (stats, cleanup, configure, watch)
- `orchestrator/` - Orchestrator operations (run commands)

**Backward Compatibility:**
All existing imports continue to work:

```python
# These imports still work exactly as before
from orka.orka_cli import run_cli_entrypoint, memory_stats, setup_logging

# Module usage also works
import orka.orka_cli
result = orka.orka_cli.run_cli_entrypoint(config, input_text)
```

**Benefits of Modular Structure:**
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved code organization
- Extensible architecture for new features
