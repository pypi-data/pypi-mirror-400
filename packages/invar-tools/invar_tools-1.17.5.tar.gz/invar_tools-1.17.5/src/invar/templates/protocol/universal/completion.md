## Task Completion

A task is complete only when ALL conditions are met:
- Check-In displayed: `✓ Check-In: [project] | [branch] | [clean/dirty]`
- Intent explicitly stated
- Contract written before implementation
- Final displayed: `✓ Final: verification PASS | <errors>, <warnings>`
- User requirement satisfied

**Missing any = Task incomplete.**
