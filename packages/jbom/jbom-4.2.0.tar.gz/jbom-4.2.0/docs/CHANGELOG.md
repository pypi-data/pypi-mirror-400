All notable changes to jBOM are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.6.0] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **Inventory Search Automation**: Enhanced `inventory` command with automated part search capabilities.
  - New `--search` flag enables automatic part searching from distributors during inventory generation.
  - Search options: `--provider` (mouser), `--api-key` (or MOUSER_API_KEY env var), `--limit` (including 'none' for unlimited), `--interactive`.
  - Priority-based ranking combines technical matching with supplier quality metrics (stock, lifecycle, price).
  - Search statistics reporting shows provider, searches performed, success/failure counts.
- **Enhanced Inventory API**: New `generate_enriched_inventory()` API function with search integration.
  - Consistent keyword-only parameter patterns following jBOM API standards.
  - `InventoryOptions` dataclass for search configuration.
  - Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation.
- **Core Search Integration Classes**:
  - `SearchResultScorer`: Intelligent scoring algorithm combining InventoryMatcher logic with supplier metrics.
  - `InventoryEnricher`: Batch processing engine with rate limiting and error recovery.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 100% test coverage for new functionality.
  - Unit tests for all new classes and API functions.
  - Functional tests for CLI integration with mocked search providers.
  - End-to-end workflow testing.

### Changed
- **Inventory Workflow Enhancement**: The `inventory` command now supports search-enhanced workflows that automatically associate inventory items with real-world purchasable parts.
- **Priority System**: Lower priority numbers indicate better choices (1=best match) for consistent ranking.

## [3.4.0] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **Config-Driven Fabricators**: Both BOM and POS commands now fully use the configuration system for fabricator definitions.
  - POS columns and header mapping now defined in YAML configuration.
  - Fabricator flags (`--jlc`, `--seeed`, etc.) and presets are auto-generated from config.
  - Config merging now uses **REPLACE** strategy for list/dict fields, allowing users to fully override default column sets.
- **Prefix Handling**: Added robust handling for `I:` (Inventory) and `C:` (Component) prefixes in fabricator part number configuration.
  - `I:` prefix is supported and stripped for lookup.
  - `C:` prefix triggers a helpful warning (as component properties are not available during part number resolution).
- **Config-Driven Classification**: Component classification now uses a rule-based engine defined in YAML configuration.
- **Debug Categories**: Added support for granular debug control via `debug_categories`.
- **POS Fabricator Support**: Added `--fabricator` option to `pos` command with presets for JLC, PCBWay, and Seeed.

### Changed
- **POS Command Refactor**: Removed hardcoded field presets from `POSGenerator`; now driven entirely by fabricator config.
- **BOM Command Refactor**: Updated to share common fabricator configuration logic with POS.
- **Configuration Logic**: Changed config merging strategy to REPLACE for dictionary fields (`bom_columns`, `pos_columns`, `part_number`, etc.) to allow removing default fields.
- Refactored `get_component_type` to use the new `ClassificationEngine`.
- Moved hardcoded classification rules to `src/jbom/config/defaults.yaml`.

### Removed
- Removed hardcoded fabricator presets (`jlc`, `seeed`, `pcbway`) from `src/jbom/common/fields.py`.

## [3.3.1] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed
- CI workflow dependency installation to include `pyproject.toml` dependencies.
- Added missing `PyYAML` dependency.
- Code formatting and linting fixes.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- **Search Command**: `jbom search` for parts via Mouser API with smart filtering.
- **Federated Inventory**: Support for loading multiple inventory files.
- **PCBWay Support**: Initial fabricator logic for PCBWay.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- **Search Command**: New `jbom search` CLI for finding parts via Mouser API.
  - Supports smart filtering: `In Stock > 0`, `Active` status, and parametric text matching.
  - Returns curated results table sorted by availability and price.
- **Fabrication Support**: Added dedicated support for **PCBWay**.
  - `jbom bom ... --fabricator pcbway` generates BOMs with specific headers (`Manufacturer Part Number`, `Distributor Part Number`) required by PCBWay assembly service.
  - Prioritizes distributor SKUs (DigiKey/Mouser) over MPNs when available.
- **Federated Inventory**: Full support for loading multiple inventory sources simultaneously.
  - `jbom bom ... -i local.csv -i jlc_export.xlsx` merges items.
  - Conflict resolution prioritizes local user definitions over imported vendor files.
- **Data Model Enhancements**: `InventoryItem` now tracks `source`, `distributor`, and `distributor_part_number`.

### Changed
- **Inventory Loader**: Now auto-maps common CSV columns (e.g., "DigiKey Part Number", "SKU") to standard internal fields.
- **BOM Generation**: Refactored to delegate column mapping to `Fabricator` plugins, enabling per-vendor CSV layouts.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-12-17

### Added
- **Back-Annotation**: New `jbom annotate` command to update KiCad schematics with data from inventory.
  - Pushes `Value`, `Footprint`, `LCSC`, and other fields back to the schematic symbol.
  - Uses UUID matching for reliability even if reference designators change.
  - Includes a "Safety Shim" to abstract S-expression parsing, preparing for future KiCad Python API adoption.
- **Placement Generation**: `jbom pos` command for pick-and-place files.
  - Supports JLC-specific rotation corrections.
  - customizable output formats.

### Changed
- **CLI Architecture**: Complete refactor to subcommand-based CLI (`jbom bom`, `jbom pos`, `jbom inventory`, `jbom annotate`).
- **Python API**: Introduced `jbom.api` as the unified entry point for programmatic use.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- **Data-Flow Architecture**: Major refactoring into `loaders/`, `processors/`, and `generators/` modules.
- **JLCPCB Private Library Support**: Native loader for JLC's Excel export format.
- **Fabricator Abstraction**: Core `Fabricator` base class to support multiple vendors (JLC, Seeed, PCBWay, Generic).

### Changed
- **Breaking**: CLI arguments significantly changed to support subcommands.
- **Breaking**: Python API imports moved to `jbom.api`.
