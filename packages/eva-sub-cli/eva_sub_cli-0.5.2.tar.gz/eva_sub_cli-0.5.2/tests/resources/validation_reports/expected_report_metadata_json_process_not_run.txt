VCF VALIDATION RESULTS
Checks whether each file is compliant with the VCF specification (http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.4.pdf).
Also checks whether the variants' reference alleles match against the reference assembly.

-
SAMPLE NAME CONCORDANCE CHECK
Checks whether information in the metadata is concordant with that contained in the VCF files, in particular sample names.
⏸ Process not run yet
-
REFERENCE GENOME INSDC CHECK
Checks that the reference sequences in the FASTA file used to call the variants are accessioned in INSDC.
Also checks if the reference assembly accession in the metadata matches the one determined from the FASTA file.
