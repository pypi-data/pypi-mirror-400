    /// Notes
    /// -----
    /// You must have MPI installed for this to work, and you must call the program with
    /// ``mpirun <executable>``, or bad things will happen.
    ///
    /// MPI runs an identical program on each process, but gives the program an ID called its
    /// "rank". Only the results of methods on the root process (rank 0) should be
    /// considered valid, as other processes only contain portions of each dataset. To ensure
    /// you don't save or print data at other ranks, use the provided ``laddu.mpi.is_root()``
    /// method to check if the process is the root process.
    ///
    /// Once MPI is enabled, it cannot be disabled. If MPI could be toggled (which it can't),
    /// the other processes will still run, but they will be independent of the root process
    /// and will no longer communicate with it. The root process stores no data, so it would
    /// be difficult (and convoluted) to get the results which were already processed via
    /// MPI.
    ///
    /// Additionally, MPI must be enabled at the beginning of a script, at least before any
    /// other ``laddu`` functions are called. For this reason, it is suggested that you use the
    /// context manager ``laddu.mpi.MPI`` to ensure the MPI backend is used properly.
    ///
    /// If ``laddu.mpi.use_mpi()`` is called multiple times, the subsequent calls will have no
    /// effect.
    ///
    /// You **must** call ``laddu.mpi.finalize_mpi()`` before your program exits for MPI to terminate
    /// smoothly.
