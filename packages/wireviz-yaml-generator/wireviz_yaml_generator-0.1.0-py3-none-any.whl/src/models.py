"""
Domain Models for the WireViz YAML Generator.

This module defines the immutable data structures (Functional Models) used throughout
the application. These models act as the contract between the Data Access Layer,
the Transformation Layer, and the Output Layer.

Design Philosophy:
- Data-Oriented: These classes are pure data carriers.
- Immutability: All classes are frozen dataclasses to prevent accidental mutation.
- Type Safety: All fields are typed, ensuring robustness.
