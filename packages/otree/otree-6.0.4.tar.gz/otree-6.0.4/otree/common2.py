    - better than hardcoding '/static/', which will fail silently if the file

    - there is the {{ static }} tag in templates.
      good to have this in python code for consistency,
      rather than making people construct it manually.
    - useful for:
        - Trials, which are generated on the server side.
          this would be useful for 2 situations:
        - live pages, where {% static %} can't be used because the template was already rendered
        - js_vars (don't want {% static %} mixed in with JS code)

    naming:
    - it shouldn't start with
    'static' because that would distract from @staticmethod in autocomplete,
    which is much more important.
    - url_of_static is more specific than url_for_static (which looks like vars_for_template but works differently)

    I don't know how useful this would be because usually people have (a) some metadata about the file,
    such as what it contains. also for DB storage & record-keeping,
    people would want to store the filename, e.g. '1.png',

    But if we see a lot of people just trying to include all images in a dir,
