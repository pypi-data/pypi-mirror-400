## Important: Port Configuration & Public Access

To make your system fully accessible and functional for external users, you must understand the port logic:

- **Website Interface (Port 8000):** Forwarding this port makes the website accessible. However, it only shows the web interface.
- **Live Stream Feed (Port 8888):** This is the default port for MediaMTX data. You must also forward this port to make the actual video broadcast viewable to the public.

> **Note:** Opening only port 8000 will result in a "video not found" or loading error for external users. Both 8000 and 8888 ports must be open.
