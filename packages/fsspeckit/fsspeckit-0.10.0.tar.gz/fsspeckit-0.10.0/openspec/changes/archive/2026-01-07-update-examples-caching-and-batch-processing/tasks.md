## 1. Caching Example

- [x] 1.1 Update `examples/caching/caching_example.py` to root the filesystem at the temp directory and use relative paths
- [x] 1.2 Ensure JSON read/write options are consistent (`as_dataframe=False` for dict JSON, or adjust the written format)

## 2. Batch Processing Example

- [x] 2.1 Update `examples/batch_processing/batch_processing_example.py` to root filesystem correctly and keep patterns consistent across parquet/csv/json
- [x] 2.2 Ensure batch iteration actually yields data and prints meaningful summaries

## 3. Validation

- [x] 3.1 Run both scripts with `.venv/bin/python` and confirm successful completion
- [x] 3.2 Include in the updated runner categories where appropriate
