Advanced Reasoning Module for Buddy AI

This module implements sophisticated reasoning capabilities including:
- Chain-of-Thought Plus with verification
- Tree of Thoughts exploration
- Analogical reasoning
- Causal inference
- Logical deduction
- Hybrid reasoning combining multiple strategies

## Usage

```python
from buddy.reasoning import AdvancedReasoning, ReasoningStrategy, AdvancedReasoningMixin

# Initialize reasoning engine
reasoner = AdvancedReasoning()

# Use specific strategy
result = reasoner.reason(
    "How can we solve climate change?",
    strategy=ReasoningStrategy.TREE_OF_THOUGHTS
)

# Use hybrid reasoning
result = reasoner.hybrid_reason("Complex problem requiring multiple approaches")

# Add to agent via mixin
class MyAgent(AdvancedReasoningMixin, Agent):
    def solve_problem(self, problem: str):
        return self.reason_advanced(problem, strategy=ReasoningStrategy.CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT_PLUS)
```

## Features

### Chain-of-Thought Plus
Enhanced chain-of-thought reasoning with step verification, contradiction detection,
and alternative path exploration when verification fails.

### Tree of Thoughts
Explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, building a tree of potential
thought processes and selecting the most promising path.

### Analogical Reasoning
Uses structural similarity to transfer knowledge from familiar domains to
novel problems, enabling creative problem-solving.

### Causal Inference
Identifies causal relationships, analyzes cause-and-effect chains, and
predicts outcomes based on causal models.

### Logical Deduction
Formal logical reasoning with proof validation, supporting modus ponens,
modus tollens, and other logical rules.

### Hybrid Reasoning
Combines multiple reasoning strategies to tackle complex problems requiring
different cognitive approaches.

## Verification System
- Step-by-step verification of reasoning chains
- Contradiction detection across reasoning steps
- Evidence validation and consistency checking
- Automatic alternative path generation when verification fails

## Strategy Selection
Intelligent strategy selection based on problem characteristics:
- Causal problems → Causal Inference
- Similarity problems → Analogical Reasoning
- Logical problems → Logical Deduction
- Complex problems → Tree of Thoughts
- General problems → Chain-of-Thought Plus
