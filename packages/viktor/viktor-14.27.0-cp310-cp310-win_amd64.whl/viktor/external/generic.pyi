    GenericAnalysis can be used to evaluate an executable on third-party infrastructure. The executable is expected
    to be blocking, i.e. if the executable is invoked from command prompt, it should wait until the executable is
    finished. For security purposes the executable that should be called has to be defined in the configuration file
    of the worker.

    Usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        files = [
            (\'input1.txt\', file1),
            (\'input2.txt\', file2)
        ]
        generic_analysis = GenericAnalysis(files=files, executable_key="someexecutable", output_filenames=["output.txt"])
        generic_analysis.execute(timeout=60)
        output_file = generic_analysis.get_output_file("output.txt")

    Exceptions which can be raised during calculation:

        - :class:`viktor.errors.LicenseError`: no license available
        - :class:`viktor.errors.ExecutionError`: generic error. Error message provides more information
