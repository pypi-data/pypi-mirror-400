# rag-scrubber

**Clean your "dirty" PDF text before feeding it to LLMs.**

`rag-scrubber` is a lightweight Python library designed for **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipelines. It automatically detects and removes recurring headers, footers, and page numbers from extracted text, and fixes broken hyphenation.

## 😟 The Problem

When extracting text from PDFs (especially corporate reports or scanned docs), you often get artifacts that confuse LLMs:

> *"The Q3 revenue was **CONFIDENTIAL REPORT 2024** higher than expected..."*

These interruptions waste tokens and degrade model performance. `rag-scrubber` cleans this mess up.

## ✨ Features

* **Auto-Header/Footer Removal:** Uses positional statistics to detect lines that repeat across pages (e.g., "Page 1 of 50", "Confidential").
* **Smart De-Hyphenation:** Fixes words split across lines (e.g., `com-` + `puter`  `computer`) without merging proper nouns.
* **Zero-Shot Configuration:** Works out of the box with sensible defaults, or tune the sensitivity yourself.
* **Lightweight:** No heavy ML dependencies. pure Python logic.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install rag-scrubber

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from rag_scrubber import RAGScrubber

# 1. Simulate dirty text (usually coming from PyPDF2 or PDFMiner)
pages = [
    "Q3 FINANCIAL REPORT - CONFIDENTIAL\nThe revenue increased by 20%.\nPage 1",
    "Q3 FINANCIAL REPORT - CONFIDENTIAL\nOperating costs were lowered.\nPage 2",
    "Q3 FINANCIAL REPORT - CONFIDENTIAL\nNew user acquisition is sta-\nble.\nPage 3"
]

# 2. Initialize the scrubber
# threshold=0.4 means if a line appears in >40% of pages, it's garbage.
scrubber = RAGScrubber(threshold=0.4)

# 3. Clean the text
clean_text = scrubber.clean(pages)

print(clean_text)

```

**Output:**

```text
The revenue increased by 20%.

Operating costs were lowered.

New user acquisition is stable.

```

## ⚙️ Advanced Usage

You can adjust the sensitivity if it is deleting too much (or too little).

```python
# Low threshold (0.1) = Very aggressive (removes anything that repeats even slightly)
# High threshold (0.9) = Very safe (only removes exact matches on almost every page)
scrubber = RAGScrubber(threshold=0.2) 

```
