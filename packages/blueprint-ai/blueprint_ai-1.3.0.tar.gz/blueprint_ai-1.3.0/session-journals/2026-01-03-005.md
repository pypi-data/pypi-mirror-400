# Blueprint Session 2026-01-03-005 — COMPLETE

## Session Focus: v1.1.0 Structured Logging + Cross-Project Interface

### Executive Summary

**Blueprint v1.1.0 shipped with structured logging and cross-project generation interface.** Successfully generated 20-task RBAC roadmap for Geaux File demonstrating full pipeline capability.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Structured Logging (v1.1.0)
- ContextVar-based correlation ID tracking for async operations
- LogEntry dataclass with JSON serialization
- StructuredLogger with json/text output modes
- Full executor integration with duration tracking
- 15 comprehensive tests (all passing)

### 2. Cross-Project Interface
- **BLUEPRINT_INTERFACE.md** — API contract for other zeOS projects
- **generate_blueprint()** — Single entry point convenience function
- Integration examples for Geaux File, SOC, Zero Echelon
- Pipeline documentation: decompose → infer → assemble

### 3. Generation Pipeline Fixes
- Fixed assembler to handle Task models from interface inferrer
- Increased decomposer max_tokens (4096 → 8192) for complex goals
- Configured ANTHROPIC_API_KEY on SOC server

### 4. Cross-Project Validation
- Generated complete 20-task RBAC roadmap for Geaux File
- 10 tiers with parallel execution paths
- Full dependency graph (DAG)
- Interface contracts for every task
