## [0.4.5] - 2025-05-26

This release properly accounts for invites in the epa room scan. This behaviour
can be configured using the `invites_grace_period` configuration option.

- fix: Account for invites sent when calculating when to kick local users from an EPA room (Jason Little)
- fix: Insure that local user actually exists prior to retrieving their permissions (Jason Little)
- chore: Cleanup linter config (Jason Little)

## [0.4.4] - 2025-05-08

This release is largely a bugfix release. The federation list is fetched less often for
non-insurance servers. Rooms with missing backfill, which especially affects invites,
are not purged anymore before the inactivity period is over. The mtls option should now
work more reliably.

- chore: more explicit typing for hostname validation for mtls (Nicolas Werner)
- fix: Conditionally utf-8 decode hostname (Emelie Graven)
- fix: Include received invites during room scans for inactive rooms to give time for the join to complete (Jason Little)
- fix: Only re-fetch the Federation List if the domain was not found on the list (Jason Little)

## [0.4.3] - 2025-05-05

This release includes a new option for using a HTTP federation list URL without mutual authentication.

Additionally, the clamped minimum interval for the room scan is reduced to 1 minute, as 1 hour is too
long for certain test usecases.

- feat: Add option for https federation list without mTLS (Emelie Graven)
- fix: Reduce minimum room scan clamp

## [0.4.2] - 2025-04-29

This release fixes users being unable to login when the permissions object used for
invites is malformed. This is accomplished by resetting the permissions data to the
server default.

Additionally, exceptions raised both during start-up to verify that an EPA/PRO server
setting matches the Federation List and while performing a room scan for insured only
rooms have been fixed.

- chore: Refactor some tests that no longer made sense and some clean up on others (Jason Little)
- chore: Refactor testing code to consolidate (Jason Little)
- fix: Avoid an exception during room scan when the room doesn't have events yet by giving it a second chance (Jason Little)
- fix: Avoid breaking login when the federation list is not available (Jason Little)
- fix: Reset permissions if they do not validate when read from the system (Jason Little)

## [0.4.1] - 2025-03-26

This release now allows system administrators to set default permissions for users. The
permission for allowing all communication is enabled by default(per previous release),
and is automatically set during login. The general prohibition for communication between
EPA mode users is not affected. Look for `default_permissions` in the README.md file for
more information

EPA mode servers will no longer directly purge rooms when kicking users after all PRO
mode users have left, allowing read-only access. Inactive rooms, however, are still
purged by default after 6 months.

Also allow disabling the check for DM when inviting other users to a room by setting
`block_invites_into_dms` to False. By default this is True.

- chore: Allow to disable the DM check for invites (Jason Little)
- chore: Only kick insured users from their rooms, do not purge (Jason Little)
- chore: Refactor `m.room.join_rules` and `m.room.history_visibility` handling for a broader pattern (Jason Little)
- feat: default permissions model for new/existing users (Jason Little)
- fix: Adjust defaultPermissions to be the snake case default_permissions (Jason Little)
- fix: Correct debug message (Jason Little)

## [0.4.0] - 2025-03-17

This release now also enforces permission checks for local users. To offset the
UX impact from that the module defaults to "allow all" in permission checks. The
old contacts API is removed because it is redundant now. The localization checks
are removed for the same reason and because they are not part of the new TIM
specs.

Additionally invites to and from public rooms for remote users are now blocked.
To do that public rooms are now forced during room creation to not federate.
This behaviour can be disabled by setting `override_public_room_federation` to
`false`.

- feat: apply permissions locally (Nicolas Werner)
- feat: Forbid local users from joining remote rooms without an invite (Jason Little)
- feat: Forbid public room federation by forcing `m.federate` to False (Jason Little)
- fix: Silence startup warning for room scan being disabled on incorrect Synapse worker (Jason Little)
- chore: Forbid local users being invited to remote public rooms (Jason Little)
- chore: Forbid local users from sending remote users an invite to a local public room (Jason Little)
- chore: Only enable the Contact Rest API when in PRO server mode (Jason Little)
- chore: Refactor several tests to include some edge cases that were missed and some house cleaning (Jason Little)

## [0.3.1] - 2025-02-25

- fix publishing via github releases

## [0.3.0] - 2025-02-25

This release contains various changes for the upcoming TIM ePA and Pro versions.
Many of these changes are potentially BREAKING changes. Please read the
change log carefully.

### Config changes

- The `api_prefix` config option is removed.
- You can now configure the `tim-type` to `epa` or `pro`. This defaults to `pro`
  for backwards compatibility.
- You can now limit the allowed room versions. This defaults to "9" and "10"
  currently. Please make sure the default room version of synapse matches one of
  the allowed room versions.
- New configuration options for the automatic background jobs for inactive rooms
  and rooms with only insurance users.

### Behaviour changes

- The old contacts API is deprecated. Clients should instead use the account
  data event to change contact rules. For a limited time period this API is
  still available in `pro` mode and tries to stay compatible, but all data is
  migrated to the new account data events, so the displayname of users might be
  missing. Additionally the API will be blocked, when any incompatible changes
  are made to the account data (like setting the default to "allow all").
- Only specific room versions are now allowed when creating a room (or upgrading
  a room).
- Rooms with no activity in the last 6 months will get automatically deleted.
  The time period can be configured.
- Rooms with only insurance users in them will get deleted 1 week after no
  non-insurance user is in the room. This time period can be configured.
- When creating a room a maximum of one invite is allowed.
- Insurance servers can't create public rooms.
- Some of those limitations do not apply to admins.
- Every API requires authentication, even the info endpoints.
- The `/tim-information` API is now available (in `pro` mode).
