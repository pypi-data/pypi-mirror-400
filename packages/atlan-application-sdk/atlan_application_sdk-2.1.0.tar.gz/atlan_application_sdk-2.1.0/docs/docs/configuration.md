## Common Configuration Patterns

### Local Development
For local development, most defaults work out of the box. Key configurations to consider:
- `ATLAN_APPLICATION_NAME`: Set to a descriptive name for your application
- `ATLAN_TENANT_ID`: Set to identify your development environment
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set to `DEBUG` for detailed logging during development

### Production Deployment
For production deployments, consider these essential configurations:
- `ATLAN_AUTH_ENABLED=true`: Enable authentication for Temporal
- `ENABLE_ATLAN_UPLOAD=true`: Enable data upload to Atlan platform
- `ATLAN_DEPLOYMENT_SECRETS`: Configure authentication secrets
- `ATLAN_WORKFLOW_HOST` and `ATLAN_WORKFLOW_PORT`: Point to production Temporal cluster
- Storage configuration: Set `DEPLOYMENT_OBJECT_STORE_NAME` and `UPSTREAM_OBJECT_STORE_NAME`

### Performance Tuning
- `ATLAN_MAX_CONCURRENT_ACTIVITIES`: Adjust based on target system capacity
- `DAPR_MAX_GRPC_MESSAGE_LENGTH`: Increase for large data processing
- Batch sizes: Adjust `*_BATCH_SIZE` variables based on memory and performance requirements
- Timeout values: Adjust `ATLAN_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `ATLAN_START_TO_CLOSE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` based on workload characteristics

### Observability Setup
- Enable telemetry: Set `ATLAN_ENABLE_OTLP_*` variables to `true`
- Configure retention: Adjust `*_RETENTION_DAYS` based on compliance requirements
- Set up cleanup: Enable `*_CLEANUP_ENABLED` to manage storage usage

## Note

Most configuration options have sensible defaults, but can be overridden by setting the corresponding environment variables. You can set these variables either in your environment or by creating a `.env` file in your project root.

Refer to the `.env.example` file in the repository for a complete example of environment variable configuration.
