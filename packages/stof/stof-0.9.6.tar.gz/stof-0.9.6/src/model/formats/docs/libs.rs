/// Std.
fn std_lib(graph: &mut Graph) {

r#"# Standard Library (Std)
Functions in the 'Std' library are foundational to Stof and therefore do not requre one to explicitly reference 'Std' when calling them. Within the standard library, you'll find functions for asserting values, printing to the console, throwing errors, putting processes to sleep, etc. Note for advanced users that it is possible to extend or modify this library as needed.

## Example Usage
```rust
#[main]
fn main() {
    Std.pln("printing a line");
    pln("printing another line"); // no 'Std' needed for this library
}
```
"#.into());

    const val = -5;
    assert_eq(val.abs(), 5);
}
```

/// Time.
fn time_lib(graph: &mut Graph) {

/// fs.
fn fs_lib(graph: &mut Graph) {

/// Http.
fn http_lib(graph: &mut Graph) {
    graph.insert_libdoc(literal!("Http"), 
r#"# HTTP Network Library (Http)
Functions for working with HTTP calls over a system network connection (async fetch, etc.). Requires the "http" feature flag to be enabled.

## Thread Pool
This library adds a thread pool in the background for processing HTTP requests, allowing Stof to keep running while requests are executed separately. Asyncronous fetch requests will create a new Stof process, which will wait for the thread pool to execute the request before returning a map with the response data. You can then await this response map when you need it, which significantly increases performance by enabling parallel HTTP requests.
