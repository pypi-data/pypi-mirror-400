# AO Agent Dev: What-if Questions over Agent Trajectories  

AO Agent Dev is a developer tool for agent builders. It supports arbitrary Python progams (like your existing ones!) and will visualize your agent's LLM and MCP calls into a dataflow graph. You can then inspect, edit and rerun this graph and understand how to fix your agent.

## Quickstart

`AO Agent Dev` integrates into VS Code or IDEs based on it, like Cursor. Simply download our [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=agentops.ao-agent-dev) and install our pip package:

```bash
pip install ao-agent-dev
```

Then, give it a spin:

#### 1. Create an Example Project

Create a folder called `my-agent` and add a file called `openai_example.py` with the following content:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

def main():
    client = OpenAI()

    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        input="Output the number 42 and nothing else",
        temperature=0
    )
    number = response.output_text

    prompt_add_1 = f"Add 1 to {number} and just output the result."
    prompt_add_2 = f"Add 2 to {number} and just output the result."

    response1 = client.responses.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", input=prompt_add_1, temperature=0)
    response2 = client.responses.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", input=prompt_add_2, temperature=0)

    sum_prompt = f"Add these two numbers together and just output the result: {response1.output_text} + {response2.output_text}"
    final_sum = client.responses.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", input=sum_prompt, temperature=0)

    print(f"Final sum: {final_sum.output_text}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Run the script to verify it works:

```bash
cd my-agent
python openai_example.py
```

#### 2. Configure AO

Run `ao-config` and set the project root to your `my-agent` folder:

```bash
ao-config
```

#### 3. Run an example

Open your `my-agent` folder in VS Code, then run the example with AO in the terminal:

```bash
ao-record openai_example.py
```

The VS Code extension will display the dataflow graph showing how data flows between the LLM calls.
