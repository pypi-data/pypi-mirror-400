# Gather problems into categories
# Note: While mathematically bounds are a type of constraint, we keep bounded problems
# separate from constrained problems in our API for cleaner problem categorization
# and to maintain clear inheritance hierarchies.
#
# Bounded problems include:
# - bounded minimisation problems (bounds only)
# - bounded quadratic problems (quadratic objective with bounds only)
#
# Constrained problems include:
# - constrained minimisation problems (equality/inequality constraints, may have bounds)
# - constrained quadratic problems (quadratic objective with constraints)

# Add bounded quadratic problems to bounded minimisation problems
bounded_minimisation_problems += bounded_quadratic_problems

# Add constrained quadratic problems to constrained minimisation problems
constrained_minimisation_problems += constrained_quadratic_problems

# Combine all problem categories
problems = (
