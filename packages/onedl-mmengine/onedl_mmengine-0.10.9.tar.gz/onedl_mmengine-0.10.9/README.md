## What's New

The VBTI development team is reviving MMLabs code, making it work with
newer pytorch versions and fixing bugs. We are only a small team, so your help
is appreciated. Also: since we don't speak or read Chinese, Chinese docs are deleted.

v0.10.6 was released on 2025-01-13.

Highlights:

- Support custom `artifact_location` in MLflowVisBackend [#1505](#1505)
- Enable `exclude_frozen_parameters` for `DeepSpeedEngine._zero3_consolidated_16bit_state_dict` [#1517](#1517)

Read [Changelog](./docs/en/notes/changelog.md#v0104-2342024) for more details.

## Introduction

MMEngine is a foundational library for training deep learning models based on PyTorch. It serves as the training engine of all OpenMMLab codebases, which support hundreds of algorithms in various research areas. Moreover, MMEngine is also generic to be applied to non-OpenMMLab projects. Its highlights are as follows:

</details>

Before installing MMEngine, please ensure that PyTorch has been successfully installed following the [official guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Install MMEngine

```bash
pip install -U onedl-mim
mim install onedl-mmengine
```

Verify the installation

```bash
python -c 'from mmengine.utils.dl_utils import collect_env;print(collect_env())'
```

## Get Started

Taking the training of a ResNet-50 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset as an example, we will use MMEngine to build a complete, configurable training and validation process in less than 80 lines of code.

<details>
<summary>Build Models</summary>

First, we need to define a **model** which 1) inherits from `BaseModel` and 2) accepts an additional argument `mode` in the `forward` method, in addition to those arguments related to the dataset.

- During training, the value of `mode` is "loss", and the `forward` method should return a `dict` containing the key "loss".
- During validation, the value of `mode` is "predict", and the forward method should return results containing both predictions and labels.

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torchvision
from mmengine.model import BaseModel

class MMResNet50(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.resnet = torchvision.models.resnet50()

    def forward(self, imgs, labels, mode):
        x = self.resnet(imgs)
        if mode == 'loss':
            return {'loss': F.cross_entropy(x, labels)}
        elif mode == 'predict':
            return x, labels
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Build Datasets</summary>

Next, we need to create **Dataset**s and **DataLoader**s for training and validation.
In this case, we simply use built-in datasets supported in TorchVision.

```python
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

norm_cfg = dict(mean=[0.491, 0.482, 0.447], std=[0.202, 0.199, 0.201])
train_dataloader = DataLoader(batch_size=32,
                              shuffle=True,
                              dataset=torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(
                                  'data/cifar10',
                                  train=True,
                                  download=True,
                                  transform=transforms.Compose([
                                      transforms.RandomCrop(32, padding=4),
                                      transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
                                      transforms.ToTensor(),
                                      transforms.Normalize(**norm_cfg)
                                  ])))
val_dataloader = DataLoader(batch_size=32,
                            shuffle=False,
                            dataset=torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(
                                'data/cifar10',
                                train=False,
                                download=True,
                                transform=transforms.Compose([
                                    transforms.ToTensor(),
                                    transforms.Normalize(**norm_cfg)
                                ])))
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Build Metrics</summary>

To validate and test the model, we need to define a **Metric** called accuracy to evaluate the model. This metric needs to inherit from `BaseMetric` and implements the `process` and `compute_metrics` methods.

```python
from mmengine.evaluator import BaseMetric

class Accuracy(BaseMetric):
    def process(self, data_batch, data_samples):
        score, gt = data_samples
        # Save the results of a batch to `self.results`
        self.results.append({
            'batch_size': len(gt),
            'correct': (score.argmax(dim=1) == gt).sum().cpu(),
        })
    def compute_metrics(self, results):
        total_correct = sum(item['correct'] for item in results)
        total_size = sum(item['batch_size'] for item in results)
        # Returns a dictionary with the results of the evaluated metrics,
        # where the key is the name of the metric
        return dict(accuracy=100 * total_correct / total_size)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Build a Runner</summary>

Finally, we can construct a **Runner** with previously defined `Model`, `DataLoader`, and `Metrics`, with some other configs, as shown below.

```python
from torch.optim import SGD
from mmengine.runner import Runner

runner = Runner(
    model=MMResNet50(),
    work_dir='./work_dir',
    train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
    # a wrapper to execute back propagation and gradient update, etc.
    optim_wrapper=dict(optimizer=dict(type=SGD, lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)),
    # set some training configs like epochs
    train_cfg=dict(by_epoch=True, max_epochs=5, val_interval=1),
    val_dataloader=val_dataloader,
    val_cfg=dict(),
    val_evaluator=dict(type=Accuracy),
)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Launch Training</summary>

```python
runner.train()
```
