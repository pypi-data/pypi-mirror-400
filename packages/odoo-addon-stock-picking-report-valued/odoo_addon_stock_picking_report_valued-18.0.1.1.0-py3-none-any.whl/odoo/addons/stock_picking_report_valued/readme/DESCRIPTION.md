Add amount information to Delivery Slip report. You can select at
partner level if picking list report must be valued or not. If the
picking is done it's valued with quantity done, otherwise the picking is
valued with reserved quantity.

Additionally, an extensible "Total Picking" section has been added to the
delivery slip report. This total is displayed only when additional amounts are
applied on top of the standard picking total, allowing downstream modules to
adjust the reported total without altering the base report.
