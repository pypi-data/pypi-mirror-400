A standalone Python API and command line interface (CLI) to control Biologic battery cyclers.

Designed and tested on MPG2 cyclers using EC-lab 11.52 and 11.61.

## Features
- CLI and Python API
- Connect to EC-lab cyclers
- Retrieve status of channels
- Load protocols onto channels
- Start and stop experiments

For parsing binary data from Biologic, we recommend [`yadg`](https://github.com/dgbowl/yadg).

## Installation
Install on a Windows PC with EC-lab >11.52 installed.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> EC-lab must have OLE/COM activated

OLE/COM is a Windows interface for programs to expose their functionality to third-parties, which is supported by EC-lab.

Open a terminal as administrator, go to your folder containing `EClab.exe` and register the server:

`cmd`
```cmd
cd "C:/Program files (x86)/EC-lab"
eclab \regserver
```

`powershell`
```powershell
cd "C:/Program files (x86)/EC-lab"
.\eclab \\regserver
```

You can also deregister in the same way with `/unregserver`.

Next, install this package with
```bash
pip install aurora-biologic
```

To see commands, use
```bash
biologic --help
```

The first time you run the command line, a config file is generated at:

`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\aurora-biologic\aurora-biologic\config.json`

which will look like:
```json
{
    "serial_to_name": {
        "12345": "MPG2-1",
        "12346": "MPG2-2"
    },
    "eclab_path": "C:/Program Files (x86)/EC-Lab/EClab.exe"
}
```
Rename your devices according to their serial number, and make sure the EC-lab executable path is correct and the same as the executable registered in the first step.

## CLI usage

You can check what devices and channels were found with
```bash
biologic pipelines
```
The pipeline ID is made up of the `{device name}-{channel index}`, such as `MPG2-1-7`

These IDs are used for other functions, for example to see the status of that channel use
```bash
biologic status MPG2-1-7
```

>[!TIP]
>See all commands with `biologic --help`.
>
>See details of a command with `biologic [command] --help` e.g. `biologic status --help`.

## API usage

Commands can also be run using Python, e.g.:

```python
import aurora_biologic as bio

print(bio.get_status())

bio.start(
    "my_pipeline_id",
    "path/to/my_experiment.mps",
    "path/to/an/output.mpr",
)
```

## Using commands over SSH
>[!WARNING]
>OLE/COM requires an interactive session to function.
>
>Standard command line functions will not work in non-interactive session, such as normal SSH from a terminal.

To use the CLI over SSH you must start a listener daemon in an interactive terminal.

On the PC with EC-lab, start the listener with:
```bash
biologic daemon
```

Then from the SSH session use normal CLI commands with the `--ssh` option, e.g.
```bash
biologic status --ssh
```

Instead of trying to run OLE/COM commands directly in the non-interactive session, it will send commands to the daemon, which will execute and reply.
