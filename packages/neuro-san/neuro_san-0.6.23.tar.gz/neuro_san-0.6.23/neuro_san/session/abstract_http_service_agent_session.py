        Some basic suggestions to help debug connectivity issues:
        1. Ensure the server is running and reachable:
           ping <server_address>
           curl -v <server_url>
        2. Check network issues:
           traceroute <server_address>  # Linux/macOS
           tracert <server_address>  # Windows
        3. Ensure you are using correct protocol (http/https) and port number;
        4. Run service health check:
           curl <server_url:server_port>
        5. Try testing with increased timeout;
        6. Did you misspell the agent and/or method name in your {path} request path?
        7. If working with a local docker container:
           7.1 Does your http port EXPOSEd in the Dockerfile match your value for AGENT_HTTP_PORT?
           7.2 Did you add a -p <server_port>:<server_port> to your docker run command line to map container port(s)
               to your local ones?
        8. Is the agent turned on in your manifest.hocon?
        9. If you are attempting to use https, know that the default server configurations do not
           provide any of the necessary certificates for this to work and any certs used will
           need to be well known.  If you're unfamiliar with this process, it's a big deal.
           Try regular http instead.
