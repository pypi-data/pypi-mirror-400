Validation tests: External verification using synthetic data.

These tests verify that validation gates correctly detect leakage using:
- Shuffled target test (definitive leakage detection)
- Synthetic AR(1) test (theoretical bounds validation)

These implement the "External-First Validation" principle from AI_CONTEXT.md.
