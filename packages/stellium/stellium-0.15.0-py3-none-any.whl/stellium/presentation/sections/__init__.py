"""
Report section implementations.

Each section extracts specific data from a CalculatedChart and formats it
into a standardized structure that renderers can consume.

This package contains domain-organized section modules:
- core: Basic chart info (ChartOverview, PlanetPosition, HouseCusps)
- aspects: Aspect-related (AspectSection, AspectPatternSection, CrossChartAspectSection)
- dignities: Dignity analysis (DignitySection, DispositorSection)
- midpoints: Midpoint analysis (MidpointSection, MidpointAspectsSection)
- timing: Time lord techniques (ZodiacalReleasingSection, ProfectionSection)
- misc: Other sections (MoonPhase, Declination, FixedStars, ArabicParts, etc.)
