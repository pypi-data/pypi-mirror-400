The `dsp-tools` package provides you with functionalities in the command line 
to interact with the [DSP-API](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-api), both remote and locally.
Additionally, it contains the `xmllib` which helps you construct the XML file required for a mass upload.


## Where To Start?

`dsp-tools` provides you with the following core functionalities.

- **Running a Local Stack:** If you want to run your own DSP stack locally, take a look [here](./local-stack.md).
- **Data Modelling:** There are several ways to create a data model with `dsp-tools`
    - Take a look at the technical specification for the [JSON file](./data-model/json-project/overview.md).
    - Or take a look at our tool to [convert Excel files into the JSON format](./data-model/excel2json.md).
    - You can create a data model on the DSP-APP. To re-use that data model on another server 
      you can use the CLI command described [here](./data-model/data-model-cli.md#get).
- **Data for Mass-Upload:**
    - If you want to create the XML file required for a mass-upload onto DSP, take a look at the [`xmllib`](./xmllib-docs/overview.md).
    - You can find an in-depth explanation of our XML file format [here](./data-file/xml-data-file.md).
      Please note, that we recommend to use the `xmllib` library to create the file 
      as we will ensure interoperability between the DSP-API requirements and your input.
    - If you want to validate and upload your XML file take a look [here](./data-file/data-file-commands.md).
      Please note, that only DaSCH employees are permitted to upload data on a production server.
