*citations_compendia.txt -- this defines which experiments and their IDs in ProteomeScout are compendia
*Human_PhosphoProteome_mapped_annotated.csv -- this is the human phosphoproteome of all of ProteomeScout mapped to Kinpred for substrate-kinase interactions. You can generate an update version of this using KSTAR helpers/generateHumanPhosphoProteome.py
* humanProteome.fasta - the reference human proteome used for kinsae-substrate mapping. This comes directly from KinPred
