# This workflow automatically merges `master` into `develop` whenever a new version tag is pushed (v*).
#
# Key points:
# - Directly merges master into develop without creating a PR.
# - Skips CI on the merge commit using [skip ci] in the commit message.
# - The code being merged has already been tested as part of the release process.
# - This ensures develop stays up-to-date with release changes (version bumps, etc.).
#
# Required repo config:
# https://github.com/organizations/easyscience/settings/secrets/actions
# https://github.com/organizations/easyscience/settings/variables/actions
# - Actions secret:   EASYSCIENCE_APP_KEY  (GitHub App private key PEM)
# - Actions variable: EASYSCIENCE_APP_ID   (GitHub App ID)
# The GitHub App must be added to the develop branch ruleset bypass list.
