# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.2.3] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- **Spinner transient parameter:** Added `transient` parameter to `cc.spinner()`
  allowing per-spinner control over disappearing behavior, overriding theme's
  `disappearing_spinners` setting. Use `cc.spinner("msg", transient=True)` to
  make a spinner disappear when done regardless of theme configuration.

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.debug("Debug message")
```
