  "response_body": "To calibrate the thrusters, you'll need to follow a step-by-step process to ensure optimal performance. First, make sure the spaceship is powered down and in a safe maintenance mode. Next, access the thruster control panel and run the diagnostic check to identify any misalignments or irregularities. Adjust the thruster output levels according to the diagnostic results, then run a test firing sequence to confirm calibration. If everything checks out, secure the panel and power the ship back up. Let me know if you need more detailed instructions on any of these steps."
