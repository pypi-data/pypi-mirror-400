Some things to check:
1. If the manifest file named above is None, know that the default points
   to the one provided with the neuro-san library for a smoother out-of-box
   experience.  If the agent you wanted is not part of that standard distribution,
   you need to set the AGENT_MANIFEST_FILE environment variable to point to a
   manifest.hocon file associated with your own project(s).
2. Check that the environment variable AGENT_MANIFEST_FILE is pointing to
   the manifest.hocon file that you expect and has no typos.
3. Does your manifest.hocon file contain a key for the agent specified?
4. Does the value for the key in the manifest file have a value of 'true'?
5. Does your agent name have a typo either in the hocon file or on the command line?
