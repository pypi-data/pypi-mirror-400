Dachser integration with Odoo.

Installation
============

It depends on the modules delivery_package_number, delivery_state and
stock_picking_volum that can be found on OCA/delivery-carrier.

Configuration
=============

To configure your Dachser services, go to:

1. *Inventory/Sales > Configuration > Delivery methods* and create a new
   one.
2. Choose *Dachser* as provider.
3. Configure your Ddachser data: API key, Division Code, Product Code,
   Term Code, Packaging Code and Packaging Type

The API key is a piece of information that you will obtain when you
register at https://api-portal.dachser.com/bi.b2b.portal/api/library and
request access to the following APIs: - transportorder: To create and
cancel shipments. - shipmentstatus: To obtain the status of shipments. -
quotations: To obtain a quote for a shipment.

It is not possible to test transportorder with an API in test mode.

There is no such thing as a test and production environment at Dachser,
so changing the environment in the carrier's corresponding smart button
will have no implications.

Usage
=====

Quotation You can obtain the cost of a shipment in a quote by using the
"Add shipment" wizard and selecting Dachser as the carrier.

Create shipment When you validate a picking linked to a Dachser carrier,
a shipment will be created, the corresponding tracking number will be
defined, and the corresponding label will be added as an attachment.

Update shipment status The status of Dachser shipments will be updated
automatically on the pickings.

Cancel shipment If a shipment has been created in Dachser (it has a
tracking number), the shipment can be canceled (depending on its
status).
