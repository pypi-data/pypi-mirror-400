## Usage

```python
import ailia_voice

import librosa
import time
import soundfile

import os
import urllib.request

# Load reference audio
ref_text = "水をマレーシアから買わなくてはならない。"
ref_file_path = "reference_audio_girl.wav"
if not os.path.exists(ref_file_path):
	urllib.request.urlretrieve(
		"https://github.com/ailia-ai/ailia-models/raw/refs/heads/master/audio_processing/gpt-sovits/reference_audio_captured_by_ax.wav",
		"reference_audio_girl.wav"
	)
audio_waveform, sampling_rate = librosa.load(ref_file_path, mono=True)

# Infer
voice = ailia_voice.GPTSoVITS()
voice.initialize_model(model_path = "./models/")
voice.set_reference_audio(ref_text, ailia_voice.AILIA_VOICE_G2P_TYPE_GPT_SOVITS_JA, audio_waveform, sampling_rate)
buf, sampling_rate = voice.synthesize_voice("こんにちは。今日はいい天気ですね。", ailia_voice.AILIA_VOICE_G2P_TYPE_GPT_SOVITS_JA)
#buf, sampling_rate = voice.synthesize_voice("Hello world.", ailia_voice.AILIA_VOICE_G2P_TYPE_GPT_SOVITS_EN)

# Save result
soundfile.write("output.wav", buf, sampling_rate)
```

## User dictionary

To load a user dictionary created with pyopenjtalk, give the user_dict_path to initialize_model.

```
voice.initialize_model(model_path = "./models/", user_dict_path = "./userdic.dic")
```
