# PAVÉS: Bajo los adoquines, la PLAYA 🏖️

[**PLAYA**](https://github.com/dhdaines/playa) is intended to get
objects out of PDF, with no dependencies or further analysis.  So,
over top of **PLAYA**, this package provides **P**DF, **A**nalyse et
**V**isualisation simplifi**É**e**S**.

Or, if you prefer, **P**DF **A**nalysis and **V**isualization for
dummi**ES**.

The goal here is not to provide elaborate, enterprise-grade,
battle-tested, cloud and AI-native, completely configurable and
confoundingly complex classes for ETL.  It's to give you some helpful
functions that you can use to poke around in PDFs and get useful
things out of them, often but not exclusively in the context of a
Jupyter notebook.

See the [https://dhdaines.github.io/paves](documentation) for more
information.  There will also be some helpful notebooks soon, to help
you.

## Installation

Install it from PyPI (as `paves`) with `pip` or `uv`, preferably in a
virtual environment.  That's all.  If you want to play around in the
source code you can use `hatch` or `uv` (your choice), for instance:

    # with hatch
    hatch shell
    # with uv
    uv venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
