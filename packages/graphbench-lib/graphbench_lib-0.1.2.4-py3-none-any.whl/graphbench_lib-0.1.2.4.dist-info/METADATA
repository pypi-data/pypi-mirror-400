# GraphBench: Next-generation graph learning benchmarking

This is the package associated with the paper [GraphBench: Next generation graph learning benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04475). 

It contains the code and tools needed to load the benchmark's datasets. 
GraphBench is a collection of benchmarking datasets across domains and tasks obtained from real-world and synthetic applications. 

## Features

GraphBench comes as a Python package with the following features: 
|        |           |                             
| :------- | :------ |
| Data Loading           | Efficiently loads graph datasets for benchmarking and experimentation across all domains and tasks.       |
| Metric Evaluation      | Supports a wide range of evaluation metrics for graph learning tasks.        |
| Automated Model Tuning | Integrates SMAC3 for automatic hyperparameter optimization of user models.   |

## Installation

We recommend using Anaconda/Miniconda during setup. The installation process is done in two steps:

1. Install [swig](https://github.com/swig/swig) via Anaconda/Miniconda (if using the optimization module): 
```conda install swig```

2. GraphBench can then be easily installed using the Python package manager pip:
```pip install graphbench-lib```

For using the optimization module ```graphbench-lib[tuning]```, it needs to be installed instead. 

Please make sure to install GraphBench before running the benchmark for the best results. 
Alternatively, one can also install from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/graphbench/package
cd package
pip install -e . 
```

## Dependencies

GraphBench uses several Python packages to load and process datasets. An overview of the required packages can be found in the list below:

- torch
- torch_geometric
- networkx
- torchmetrics
- numpy
- pandas
- requests
- tqdm
- scikit-learn

Optionally, SMAC3 is used for the optimization module. 

## Usage

The package can be easily used to get selected datasets from the GraphBench tasks:

```
import graphbench
Loader = graphbench.Loader(root, dataset_name)
datasets = Loader.load()
```

Furthermore, standardized evaluation metrics can be obtained using the following methods:

```
Evaluator = graphbench.Evaluator(metric_name)
metric_results = Evaluator.evaluate()
```

In order to use all datasets of a domain easily, each domain corresponds to one ```dataset_name``` variable:

| Domain   | Dataset_name           |                             
| :------- | :------ |
| Social media | socialnetwork |
| Combinatorial optimization | co |
| SAT solving | sat |
| Algorithmic reasoning | algorithmic_reasoning_easy, algorithmic_reasoning_medium, algorithmic_reasoning_hard |
| Electronic circuits | electronic_circuits |
| Chip design | chipdesign |
| Weather forecasting | weather |

Note that for algorithmic reasoning, the download always includes all datasets for a given task. We plan to change this in the future. 

For a complete list of the datasets, see the accompanying [website](https://graphbench.io) or the ```datasets.csv``` file. The corresponding metrics are in the ```master.csv``` file.
