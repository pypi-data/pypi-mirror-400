"""Test that dependency manager uses correct Python package import names.

This test ensures that the dependency manager checks for packages using their
actual Python import names (e.g., 'yaml') rather than their PyPI package names
(e.g., 'PyYAML').

Regression test for: https://github.com/HenriquesLab/rxiv-maker/issues/XXX
Where Homebrew installations were showing false positives for missing dependencies
because the dependency manager was checking for 'pyyaml' instead of 'yaml'.
