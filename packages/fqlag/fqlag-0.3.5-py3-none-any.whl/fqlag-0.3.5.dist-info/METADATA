## About
`fqlag` is a python library to characterize the variability in the frequency domain of light curves that are not continuously sampled. This supersedes the `plag` library, with a different implementation that is more stable during the calculations.

Both libraries implement the method presented in Zoghbi et. al. (2013) paper ([Astrophysical Journal; 2013. 777. 24](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5852)) to calculate periodogram and time/phase lags in the frequency domain from unevenly-sampled light curves.


## Installation
- pip install fqlag


## Getting Started
- Check out the [Getting Started](tutorials/getting-started.ipynb) notebook, which can be browsed [here](tutorials/getting-started.md).
- There are additional example in the [`tutorials/test.py`](tutorials/test.py) file.


## Cite
Please cite the following paper when using the code.
