    The following rules are applied sequentially:

    - If a custom slicer is provided and the predicator returns True,
        the custom slicer is used to process the object.

    - If the object is dict-like (Mapping), each value is sliced recursively.

    - If the object is ndarray-like, such as numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, or
        jax.Array, the array is sliced along the dimension whose size matches `hint`.
        For example, if an array has the shape (3, 3, 5000, 256, ...) and `hint=5000`,
        the array will be sliced along `axis=2`. If there are multiple dimensions
        or none matched, an error is raised. Specially, shapes of (1,) or (0,) are treated
        as scalars and not sliced.

    - If the object is a sequence (list, tuple, etc.), each element is sliced
        recursively.

    - Other types are not sliced and returned as is.

    Args:
        obj (Any): nested structure to slice.
        sl (slice): slice object.
        hint (int): dimension hint.
        _path (NodePath, optional): internal use only.

    Returns:
