tool: |
  Update a memory in the vector store by replacing the old memory with new content.
  Use this tool when:
  - The user wants to modify or correct existing information
  - A memory needs to be updated with new details while keeping its relevance
  - Information has changed and the old memory is no longer accurate
  - You need to refine or improve the clarity of stored information
  Memory ID can be obtained from previous memory retrieval results.

tool_multiple: |
  Update multiple memories in the vector store by replacing old memories with new content.
  Use this tool for batch updates when:
  - The user wants to modify or correct multiple pieces of existing information
  - Multiple memories need to be updated with new details while keeping their relevance
  - Information has changed across multiple memories
  - You need to refine or improve multiple stored memories at once
  Memory IDs can be obtained from previous memory retrieval results.

memory_id: |
  The unique identifier (memory_id) of the old memory to be replaced.
  This ID is returned when memories are retrieved or added.

when_to_use: |
  Optional condition description for when to retrieve this memory.
  This field is used for vector embedding to improve retrieval accuracy by providing contextual information.
  Examples:
  - "when user asks about authentication"
  - "when deploying to production"
  - "when using search_tool"
  - "when handling error cases"

memory_content: |
  The new content of the memory to store.
  Should be a clear, concise statement that captures the updated information to remember.
  Keep it focused on a single piece of information for better retrieval accuracy.

metadata: |
  Optional metadata for the new memory, providing additional context. Can include:
  - time: The timestamp or date associated with the memory (e.g., "2025-01-06 10:30:00")
  - source: Where this information came from (e.g., "user_input", "documentation", "observation")
  - tags: List of tags for categorization (e.g., ["authentication", "security"])
  - Any other custom key-value pairs relevant to the memory

memories: |
  A list of memory update objects.
