# **NexusLIMS** - An Automated Laboratory Information Management System for Electron Microscopy

NexusLIMS automatically generates experimental records by extracting metadata from microscopy data
files and harvesting information from laboratory calendar systems.

```{note}
This is a fork of the original NexusLIMS project maintained by Datasophos.
This fork is **not affiliated with NIST**. For the official NIST version,
please visit the [original repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/NexusLIMS).
```

## Key Features

- **Automated Record Building** - Automatically build metadata records for electron microscopy experiments, with metadata
extraction from proprietary formats, preview image generation,
and more!
- **Facility Management Integration** - NexusLIMS integrates
with the
[NEMO lab management](https://www.atlantislabs.io/nemo/)
system for harvesting of experimental sessions and
instrument information.
- **Comprehensive support for common Electron Microscopy file formats** - NexusLIMS extracts detailed metadata from DigitalMicrograph DM3/DM4 files, FEI/Thermo TIF images, Tescan TIF images, Zeiss TIF images, FEI TIA (.ser/.emi), EDAX (.spc/.msa) EDS spectra, and more
- **Temporal File Clustering** - Intelligent grouping of files into Acquisition Activities based on temporal analysis
- **Extensible Architecture** - Plugin-based extractor system and instrument profiles for easy customization
- **Structured XML Records** - Standards-compliant records with comprehensive session and technical metadata
- **Metadata Standardization** - Emerging standardization using [EM Glossary](https://emglossary.helmholtz-metadaten.de/) terms and Pydantic validation (work in progress)
- **Physical Unit Management** - Automatic normalization of physical quantities (voltages, distances, times) to preferred units via Pint
