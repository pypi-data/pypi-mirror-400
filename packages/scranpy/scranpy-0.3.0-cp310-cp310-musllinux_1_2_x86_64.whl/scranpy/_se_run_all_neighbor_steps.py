    Concurrently run all steps involving a nearest-neighbor search, using the same nearest-neighbor search index built from an existing embedding.
    This includes the t-SNE, UMAP and graph-based clustering.
    Internally, this uses :py:func:`~scranpy.run_all_neighbor_steps` on a reduced dimension entry in :py:class:`~singlecellexperiment.SingleCellExperiment.SingleCellExperiment`.

    Args:
        x:
            A :py:class:`~singlecellexperiment.SingleCellExperiment.SingleCellExperiment` object or one of its subclasses.
            Rows correspond to genomic features and columns correspond to cells.

        umap_output_name:
            Name of the reduced dimension entry in which to store the UMAP coordinates in the output object.
            If ``None``, the UMAP is not computed.

        more_umap_args:
            Additional arguments for UMAP, to pass to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_all_neighbor_steps` as ``run_umap_options``.
            If ``None``, the UMAP is not computed.

        tsne_output_name:
            Name of the reduced dimension entry in which to store the t-SNE coordinates in the output object.
            If ``None``, the t-SNE is not computed.

        more_tsne_args:
            Additional arguments for t-SNE, to pass to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_all_neighbor_steps` as ``run_tsne_options``.
            If ``None``, the t-SNE is not computed.

        build_graph_name:
            Name of the metadata entry in which to store the nearest neighbor graph.
            If ``None``, the graph is not stored.

        more_build_graph_args:
            Additional arguments for graph construction, to pass to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_all_neighbor_steps` as ``more_build_graph_args``.

        cluster_output_name:
            Name of the column of the column data in which to store the cluster assignments.
            If ``None``, graph-based clustering is not performed.
        
        cluster_meta_name:
            Name of the metadata entry in which to store additional clustering outputs.
            If ``None``, additional outputs are not stored.

        more_cluster_graph_args:
            Additional arguments for graph-based clustering, to pass to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_all_neighbor_steps` as ``more_cluster_graph_args``.
            If ``None``, the graph-based clustering is not performed.

        nn_parameters:
            Parameters for the nearest-neighbor search.

        num_threads:
            Number of threads to use, passed to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_all_neighbor_steps`.

        more_neighbor_args:
            Additional arguments to pass to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_all_neighbor_steps`.

        reddim_type:
            Name or index of the reduced dimensions of ``x`` on which to perform the nearest neighbor search.
            Alternatively a tuple, where the first element contains the name of an alternative experiment of ``x``,
            and the second element contains the name/index of an embedding in that alternative experiment.

    Returns:
        A copy of ``x``, with additional coordinates in its reduced dimensions and clustering output in its column data.
        Additional information may also be stored in its metadata.

    Examples:
        >>> import scranpy
        >>> sce = scranpy.get_test_rna_data_se("pca")
        >>> sce = scranpy.run_all_neighbor_steps_se(
