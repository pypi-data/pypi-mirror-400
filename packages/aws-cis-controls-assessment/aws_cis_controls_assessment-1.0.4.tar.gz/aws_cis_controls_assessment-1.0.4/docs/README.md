# AWS CIS Controls Compliance Assessment Framework Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the AWS CIS Controls Compliance Assessment Framework. This production-ready, enterprise-grade framework evaluates AWS account security posture against CIS Controls Implementation Groups (IG1, IG2, IG3) using AWS Config rule specifications without requiring AWS Config to be enabled.

## Documentation Structure

### User Documentation
- **[Installation Guide](installation.md)** - Complete installation and setup instructions
- **[User Guide](user-guide.md)** - Comprehensive usage guide with examples
- **[CLI Reference](cli-reference.md)** - Complete command-line interface reference
- **[Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions

### Technical Documentation
- **[Developer Guide](developer-guide.md)** - Extending and customizing assessments
- **[Assessment Logic](assessment-logic.md)** - Detailed assessment logic documentation
- **[Config Rule Mappings](config-rule-mappings.md)** - Complete mapping of CIS Controls to AWS Config rules

## Quick Start

1. **Install the framework**: `pip install aws-cis-assessment`
2. **Configure AWS credentials**: `aws configure` or set environment variables
3. **Run basic assessment**: `aws-cis-assess assess`
4. **View results**: Open the generated HTML report

## Key Features

- **✅ Complete Coverage**: 136 AWS Config rules (131 CIS Controls + 5 bonus security rules)
- **✅ Production Ready**: Enterprise-tested with comprehensive error handling
- **✅ Performance Optimized**: Handles large-scale assessments efficiently
- **✅ Multiple Output Formats**: JSON, HTML, and CSV reports with detailed remediation guidance
- **✅ No AWS Config Required**: Direct AWS API calls based on Config rule specifications
- **✅ Enterprise Architecture**: Scalable, maintainable framework with audit trails

## Implementation Groups Overview

### IG1 - Essential Cyber Hygiene (93 Config Rules) ✅
**100% Coverage Achieved**
Foundational safeguards for all enterprises:
- Asset Inventory and Management (6 rules)
- Identity and Access Management (15 rules)
- Data Protection and Encryption (8 rules)
- Network Security Controls (20 rules)
- Logging and Monitoring (13 rules)
- Backup and Recovery (12 rules)
- Security Services Integration (5 rules)
- Configuration Management (9 rules)
- Vulnerability Management (5 rules)

### IG2 - Enhanced Security (+37 Config Rules) ✅
**100% Coverage Achieved**
Additional controls for regulated environments:

- Enhanced Monitoring (3 rules)
- CodeBuild Security (4 rules)
- Vulnerability Scanning (1 rule)
- Network Segmentation (5 rules)
- Auto-scaling Security (1 rule)
- Enhanced Access Controls (8 rules)

### IG3 - Advanced Security (+1 Config Rule) ✅
**100% Coverage Achieved**
Sophisticated controls for high-risk environments:
- API Gateway WAF Integration (1 rule)
- Critical for preventing application-layer attacks
- Required for high-security environments

### Bonus Security Rules (+5 Rules) ✅
**Additional Value Beyond CIS Requirements**
- Enhanced logging security (`cloudwatch-log-group-encrypted`)
- Network security enhancement (`incoming-ssh-disabled`)
- Data streaming encryption (`kinesis-stream-encrypted`)
- Network access control (`restricted-incoming-traffic`)
- Message queue encryption (`sqs-queue-encrypted-kms`)

## Production Status
