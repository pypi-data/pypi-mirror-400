* Difference from upstream: I do not allow nested obejcts (such as RRHeader in DNS*)

* org.org DON'T implement the GICSIndustryMap
https://github.com/owasp-amass/open-asset-model/blob/main/org/org.go#L73

* Tests need to be rethought and make consistent

* Create a decorators @asset @property @property that enforce that implement dataclass

* General/Identifier contains naming inconsistencies (expiration_date instead of expired_at like in ipnet_record for instance)
