  "response_body": "To calibrate your spaceship's thrusters, you'll need to follow a step-by-step process to ensure optimal performance. First, make sure the ship is powered down and secure. Then, access the thruster control panel and initiate the calibration mode. The system will prompt you to run a series of test firings at different power levels. Monitor the output readings and adjust the alignment as needed until the readings are within the recommended range. Once complete, save the calibration settings and restart the system to apply the changes."
