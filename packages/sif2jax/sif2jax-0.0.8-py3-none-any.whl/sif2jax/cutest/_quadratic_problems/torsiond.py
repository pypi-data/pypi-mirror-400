class TORSIOND(AbstractBoundedQuadraticProblem):
    """The quadratic elastic torsion problem.

    The problem comes from the obstacle problem on a square.

    The square is discretized into (px-1)(py-1) little squares. The heights of the
    considered surface above the corners of these little squares are the problem
    variables. There are px**2 of them.

    The dimension of the problem is specified by Q, which is half the number
    discretization points along one of the coordinate direction. Since the number of
    variables is P**2, it is given by 4Q**2

    This is a variant of the problem stated in the report quoted below. It corresponds
    to the problem as distributed in MINPACK-2.
