    Attributes:
        DEBUG: Debug log level. Intended for detailed debugging information.
        INFO: Info log level. Used for general information about program execution.
        WARN: Warning log level. Indicates potential issues or unexpected behavior.
        WARNING: Warning log level. Indicates potential issues or unexpected behavior.
        ERROR: Error log level. Indicates errors that do not prevent program execution.
        EXCEPTION: Error log level. Indicates errors that do not prevent program execution.
        CRITICAL: Critical log level. Indicates severe errors that might lead to program failure.
        FATAL: Critical log level. Indicates severe errors that might lead to program failure.
