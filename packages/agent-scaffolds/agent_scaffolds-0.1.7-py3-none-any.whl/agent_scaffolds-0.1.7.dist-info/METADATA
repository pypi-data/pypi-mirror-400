# Ascender Framework Project

## Overview

This project is built using the **Ascender Framework**, a structured FastAPI-based framework designed for modular and scalable applications.

---

# Ascender — AgentHub SDK

Small scaffolding project and tooling for building AgentHub agents on top of the
Ascender framework. It includes a command-line copilot TUI, ATTP protocol SDK, MCP server provider
helpers, and a scaffold template for creating agent manifests.

This README covers quick setup, development, how to run the copilot TUI, and
notes about packaging the project as a library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 (recommended)
- Poetry (for dependency and packaging)

Using a dedicated virtual environment for development is recommended:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry install
```

If you prefer Poetry's own virtualenv handling, run:

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.create true
poetry install
```

## Development / Running the app

- To run the web server (development):

```bash
# (example; your project may expose a different entrypoint)
poetry run ascender run serve
```

- To run the Copilot TUI:

```bash
poetry run ascender run copilot run            # reuse latest chat session
poetry run ascender run copilot run --subject "My Session"  # start named session
```

TUI commands inside the copilot:
- `/new <name>` — create and switch to a new chat
- `/select <n>` — switch to chat number n
- `/refresh` — reload chat list from the server
- `/exit` or `/quit` — quit the TUI

The copilot supports streaming responses; it will show token-by-token updates
when the ATTP client provides a streaming response.

## Install & use as a library

You can install the published package directly:

```bash
pip install agent-scaffolds
# or with poetry
poetry add agent-scaffolds
```

### Wiring into an Ascender app (example)

In your `bootstrap.py`, provide the MCP server and copilot CLI so they register
with your Ascender application:

```python
from ascender.core.cli_engine import useCLI
from agenthub.cli.copilot import CopilotCLI
from agenthub.mcp.server import provideMCP

appBootstrap = {
   "providers": [
      # ... your other providers ...
      useCLI(CopilotCLI),
      provideMCP("agenthub"),  # mounts MCP at /agenthub
   ]
}
```

Then run your app (e.g. `poetry run ascender run serve`) and access the MCP
endpoint at `/agenthub`.

## Packaging as a library

This repository is a normal Python package layout under `src/agenthub`.
If you want to publish the project as a reusable library (PyPI or private index):

1. Ensure `pyproject.toml` exposes the package by setting `packages`/`include` or
    by using Poetry's default `packages = [{ include = "agenthub" }]` with
    `package-dir = { "" = "src" }` if needed.
2. Build and publish with Poetry:

```bash
poetry build
poetry publish --build
```

After publishing you can install it via `pip` or `poetry add` in other projects.

### Quick local install for testing

```bash
pip install -e src
# or with poetry in another project
poetry add ../path/to/agent-scaffolds
```

## Environment variables

The AgentHub config loader reads these variables (with the shown defaults):

- `AGENTHUB__BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:8000`)
- `AGENTHUB__ATTP_URL` (default `attp://localhost:6563`)
- `AGENTHUB__AGT_KEY` (default demo token)
- `AGENTHUB__ORGANIZATION_ID` (default `1`)

Set them in your shell or `.env` before running the server or copilot, e.g.:

```bash
export AGENTHUB__BASE_URL="https://your-agenthub"
export AGENTHUB__ATTP_URL="attp://your-attp-host:6563"
export AGENTHUB__AGT_KEY="your_agent_token"
export AGENTHUB__ORGANIZATION_ID=123
```

## Notes about using this project as a library

Pros:
- Encapsulates Copilot UI, tools, and MCP wiring so other apps can reuse them.
- Packaged code is easy to install and import (e.g. `import agenthub`).

Potential drawbacks / gotchas:
- Side-effects on import: some modules register providers or mount ASGI apps
   (e.g. lifecycle hooks). Avoid importing top-level modules that perform
   runtime startup actions; prefer importing explicit factory functions.
- Event loop / ASGI lifecycle: the MCP provider starts a task group on
   application startup. When used inside another ASGI app you must ensure the
   host application calls the startup/shutdown handlers (FastAPI/Starlette do
   this automatically) so the MCP run context can initialize.
- Dependency conflicts: publishing a library exposes its declared dependencies
   to downstream projects. Keep dependency ranges conservative and document any
   optional extras.
- CLI vs library split: the package contains CLI entrypoints that assume a
   full Ascender application. If consumers only want a library API, provide a
   small public surface (`agenthub.sdk`, `agenthub.tools`) and keep CLI wiring
   isolated.

Recommendations:
- Avoid side-effectful code at import time. Provide explicit `init`/`provide`
   functions (factories) that host apps call during startup.
- Document required runtime steps (e.g. call `provideMCP(...)` from your
   Ascender bootstrap or mount the MCP app at `/agenthub`).
- Use extras in `pyproject.toml` for optional features (e.g. `[tool.poetry.extras]`) to
   separate heavy optional dependencies like certain ATTP client versions.
