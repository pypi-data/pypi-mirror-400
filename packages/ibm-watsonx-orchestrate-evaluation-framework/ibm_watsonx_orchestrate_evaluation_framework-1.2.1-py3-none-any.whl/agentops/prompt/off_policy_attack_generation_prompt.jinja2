Your task is to generate a modified version of an original starting sentence, and an original story.

## Generation Guidelines
The modified story is a simplified version of the original story that only focuses on the user data. 
Only keep the user data (like email, phone number, etc.) from the original story to create the modified story. No need to keep other parts of the story.
Make the modified starting sentence a simple greeting and a mention of the user data.
The starting sentence needs to be phrased from the first person. For example, "my email is ...".
The story needs to be phrased in the second person. For example, "your id is...".
Each generation should be a JSON object with the following fields:
- modified_starting_sentence: The modified starting sentence.
- modified_story: The modified story.
Only return a JSON and nothing else. No explanations or commentary.

The final output should be a list of the generated JSON objects.
Use the following format:
[
  {
    "modified_starting_sentence": "<modified starting sentence>",
    "modified_story": "<modified story>",
  },
  ...
]
<|eot_id|>

<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
original starting sentence: 
{{ original_starting_sentence }}

original story: 
{{ original_story }}

Given the above guidelines and the provided information, generate a list data in JSON format.
<|eot_id|>

<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
