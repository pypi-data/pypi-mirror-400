"""Custom gradient transformations for eFormer optimizers.

This submodule provides custom optax-compatible gradient transformations
including advanced optimizers like Mars and White Kron variants (Quad/Skew).

Modules:
    mars: Mars (Matrix-wise Adaptive Regularized Scaling) optimizer.
    white_kron: White Kron optimizer variants with different preconditioner updates.
    utils: Utility functions for creating schedulers and weight decay transformations.

Key Components:
    - scale_by_mars: Gradient scaling transformation for Mars optimizer.
    - mars: Complete Mars optimizer with learning rate scaling.
    - scale_by_quad: Gradient scaling with QUAD preconditioner update.
    - scale_by_skew: Gradient scaling with skew preconditioner update.
    - quad: Complete Quad optimizer with weight decay and learning rate.
    - skew: Complete Skew optimizer with weight decay and learning rate.
    - optax_add_scheduled_weight_decay: Weight decay with scheduled rate.
    - create_linear_scheduler: Linear learning rate schedule builder.
    - create_cosine_scheduler: Cosine learning rate schedule builder.
