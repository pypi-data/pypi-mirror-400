Welcome to `pyAUSAXS`, the perhaps fastest Python tool for evaluating the scattering intensity of biological samples and crystals. 
`pyAUSAXS` is a Python wrapper around [`AUSAXS`](https://github.com/AUSAXS/AUSAXS), the high-performance C++ backend, offering easy
access to most of its features. 

## Who is this for?
`pyAUSAXS` offers highly efficient calculation of the expected scattering intensity of your structures. These calculations include
form factors, and hydration shell & excluded volume modeling. Calculations without these solvent effects are also possible, if only
the pure Debye calculation is of interest. For a full overview of how it works, see the `AUSAXS` article:
[10.1107/S160057672500562X](https://doi.org/10.1107/S160057672500562X).

## Installation
To install, simply run:
```bash
pip install pyausaxs
```
and you are good to go!

## Usage
Proper documentation is currently being written. For now, please refer to the runnable examples [here](https://github.com/AUSAXS/pyAUSAXS/tree/master/examples).
