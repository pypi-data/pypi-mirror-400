"""
Fluent Builder API for constructing Agent Definitions.

This package provides a developer-friendly fluent API for building
AgentDefinition entities. The builders use internal mutable state
but produce immutable domain entities.

⚠️ SDK BOUNDARY WARNING ⚠️
These builders create DESCRIPTIONS of agents/workflows/nodes, not executables.
Building locally does NOT mean the platform will execute it.
All execution authority belongs to Platform Core.

See: https://docs.ainalyn.io/sdk/platform-boundaries/
