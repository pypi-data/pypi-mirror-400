    AsyncCallbackHandler implementation that intercepts agent-level chatter

    We are currently only listening to on_llm_end(), but there are many other
    callbacks to hook into, most of which are not really productive.
    Some are overriden here to explore, others are not.  See the base

            LoggingCallbackHandler hooks into to produce egregiously chatty logs.
