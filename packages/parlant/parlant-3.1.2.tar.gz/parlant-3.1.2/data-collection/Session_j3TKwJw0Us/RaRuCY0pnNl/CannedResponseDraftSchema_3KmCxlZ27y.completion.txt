  "response_body": "To calibrate your spaceship's thrusters, you'll need to follow a series of steps to ensure optimal performance. First, make sure the ship is powered down and in a safe environment. Next, access the thruster control panel and run the diagnostic check. Adjust the thruster alignment according to the diagnostic results, then test-fire each thruster at low power to confirm the calibration. Repeat the process if any discrepancies are detected. Let me know if you need more detailed instructions on any of these steps."
