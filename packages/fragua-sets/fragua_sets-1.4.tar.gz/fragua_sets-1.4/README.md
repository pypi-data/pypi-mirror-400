# Fragua Sets

**Fragua Sets** is a Python package that complements the **Fragua framework** by providing a set of **pre-configured FraguaSets**.  
These sets can be used directly within a **Fragua environment**, enabling rapid development and testing of ETL workflows.

**Fragua** itself is a Python framework designed to orchestrate **ETL pipelines** using **FraguaAgents**, which execute **pipeline steps** and **functions** to efficiently process data.  
With **Fragua Sets**, you get ready-to-use FraguaSets, allowing you to start working in a Fragua environment without manual configuration.
