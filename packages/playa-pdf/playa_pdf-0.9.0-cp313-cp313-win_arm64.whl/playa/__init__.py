"""
PLAYA ain't a LAYout Analyzer... but it can help you get stuff
out of PDFs.

Basic usage:

    with playa.open(path) as pdf:
        for page in pdf.pages:
            print(f"page {page.label}:")
            for obj in page:
                print(f"    {obj.object_type} at {obj.bbox}")
                if obj.object_type == "text":
                    print(f"        chars: {obj.chars}")

    Note: Potential slowness
        When using multiple processes, this results in the entire
