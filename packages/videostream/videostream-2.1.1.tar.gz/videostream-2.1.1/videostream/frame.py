        Returns the number of bytes to the next row.  This value is not the
        width but rather the width * pixel_size + padding; where pixel_size
        refers to the number of bytes for a major pixel, and padding is extra
        area before the next row.

        Major pixel has varying meaning.  For RGB type images a pixel is the
        combination of R,G,B, and possibly A or X (X means ignored).  An RGB
        image could also be called RGB888 which refers to 3 8-bit pixels. For
        YUV type images it gets a little more complicated.  For packed formats
        such as YUYV the pixel stride is 2 (16bits per pixel) as the pixels are
        an alternating pattern of YU/YV, this also implies the resolution must
        be a factor of 2.  For planar formats such as I420 or NV12 the YUV
        planes are separated, differently.  I420 has a plane for Y and a plane
        for UV (packed).  NV12 has a plane for each of Y, U, and V.  There is
        also some discrepancy in interpretation between vendors, our choice is
        based on the underlying hardware/software/drivers used by videostream.

        Padding is commonly used for cropping, by adjusting the starting pixel
        you can choose the x,y starting coordinate from the left,top along with
        stride to overshoot the width of the image to align with the next x
        coordinate.
