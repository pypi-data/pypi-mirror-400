## ✨ Why ElSabio?

**Usage, grid and customers — united for insight**

Utility companies face growing demands for transparency, efficiency, and adaptability in their day to day operations.
ElSabio unlocks insights by combining three key perspectives:

- 📈 **Meter data** – covering consumption and production patterns as well as operational signals like meter events and alarms,

- 🕸 **Grid topology** – showing how assets are organized and related to customers,

- 👥 **Customer information** – highlighting how different customer and asset groups use and interact with the grid.

By bringing these perspectives together ElSabio enables blending this data into actionable insights.
This integrated view helps utilities design fairer tariffs, understand the impact on different customer groups
and forecast income with greater accuracy. It also makes it possible to act on grid faults before customers notice.
