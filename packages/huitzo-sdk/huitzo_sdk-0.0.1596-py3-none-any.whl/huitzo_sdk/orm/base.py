"""SQLAlchemy declarative base for plugin models.

Plugins should share the backend's DeclarativeBase so foreign keys to
core tables (e.g., users) can be resolved correctly. The backend injects
its Base at startup via `register_base`; until then a lightweight
fallback base is used so unit tests can run in isolation.
