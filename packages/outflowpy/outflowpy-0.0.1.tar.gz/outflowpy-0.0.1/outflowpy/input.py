class Input:
    r"""
    Input to PFSS/outflow field modelling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    br : sunpy.map.GenericMap
        Boundary condition of radial magnetic field at the inner surface.
        Note that the data *must* have a cylindrical equal area projection.
    nr : int
        Number of cells in the radial direction on which to calculate the 3D solution.
    rss : float
        Radius of the source surface, in units of solar radius
    corona_temp : float 
        Temperature of the corona for the implicit solar wind solution (see paper for details)
    mf_constant : float
        Magnetofrictional constant factor 

    Notes
    -----
    The input must be on a regularly spaced grid in :math:`\phi` and
    :math:`s = \cos (\theta)`. See `outflowpy.grid` for more
    information on the coordinate system.
