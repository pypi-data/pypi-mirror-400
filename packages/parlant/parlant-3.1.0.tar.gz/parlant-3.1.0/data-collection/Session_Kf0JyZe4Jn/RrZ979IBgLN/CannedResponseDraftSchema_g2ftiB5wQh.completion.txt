  "response_body": "To calibrate your spaceship's thrusters, you'll need to follow a step-by-step process to ensure optimal performance and safety. First, make sure the ship is powered down and secure. Next, access the thruster control panel and run the diagnostic sequence to check for any irregularities. Adjust the thruster alignment according to the diagnostic results, then perform a test firing at low power to verify the calibration. Repeat the adjustments as needed until the thrusters operate within the recommended parameters. Let me know if you need more detailed instructions on any of these steps."
