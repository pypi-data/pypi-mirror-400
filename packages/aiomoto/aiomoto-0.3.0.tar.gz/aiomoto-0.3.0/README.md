# aiomoto

`aiomoto` is Moto for aiobotocore / aioboto3 (while staying compatible with classic
botocore / boto3). It adapts Moto's stubber so async and sync clients share the same
in-memory backend: you can write to a mock S3 bucket with boto3 and read it back via
aiobotocore or aioboto3 in the same process.

## Supported today

- `mock_aws()` usable as `with` or `async with`, guarding against real HTTP requests.
- Actively exercised in tests: S3 (CRUD + listings + streaming reads), DynamoDB
  (create/describe/put/get), Secrets Manager, SES, SNS, SQS, KMS, STS, Lambda, Events,
  Kafka/MSK, and s3fs async integration — all sharing one Moto backend between sync
  boto3/botocore and async aiobotocore/aioboto3 clients.
- Other Moto services often work out of the box through the same patch layer; if you
  hit a service-specific gap, open an issue with a minimal repro so we can add a
  focused slice.

## Motivation

Like many others I've wanted to use Moto with aiobotocore and aioboto3 but found that
wasn't supported, see:

- <https://github.com/getmoto/moto/issues/2039>
- <https://github.com/getmoto/moto/issues/8694>

The primary motivation for attempting to create an aiomoto repo came from this issue
<https://github.com/getmoto/moto/issues/8513>
which states aiobotocore support is out of scope for moto and the current primary moto
maintainer suggested creating an aiomoto repo.

## Related Work

<https://github.com/dazza-codes/pytest-aiomoto> was an earlier attempt at this but not
really maintained now.

There is discussion on aiobotocore repo about moto support here
<https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore/discussions/1300>

Both the above approaches as far as I'm aware rely on the Moto's
[server mode](https://docs.getmoto.org/en/latest/docs/server_mode.html) which I don't
want to use (mainly as I found server mode was slower than other local AWS services
like dynamodb-local in-memory and I also wanted to run tests in parallel without
worrying about port clashes or race conditions). In short I don't want any server and I
want aiomoto to support the moto like mock contexts in the same thread / process as the
tests run in.

## Installation

```bash
pip install aiomoto
```

aiomoto exposes the same Moto service extras, so you can install Moto plus the
dependencies required for the specific AWS services you use (for example
`aiomoto[s3]`, `aiomoto[dynamodb]`, or `aiomoto[all]`). Moto's extras are
service selectors for dependency sets (use `moto[all]` if you want everything),
rather than features provided by aiomoto itself. See the Moto install guide:
[Moto install guide](https://docs.getmoto.org/en/latest/docs/getting_started.html)

aiomoto-specific extras like `pandas` and `polars` behave like standard optional
dependencies, adding those libraries and their support stack on top of Moto.

Server mode requires Moto's server extra:

```bash
pip install "aiomoto[server]"
```

Pandas and Polars integrations are optional extras that add their own
dependencies:

```bash
pip install "aiomoto[pandas]"
pip install "aiomoto[polars]"
```

## Usage

Use `aiomoto.mock_aws` as a drop-in replacement for Moto's `mock_aws` that works
with both synchronous boto3/botocore clients and asynchronous aiobotocore/aioboto3
clients in the same process. It supports `with` and `async with` (and can decorate
sync/async callables).

### Use as a decorator

Use `@mock_aws` as a decorator when you want Moto started/stopped for the span of
a test function. Both sync and async callables are supported; omit parentheses
when you are not passing arguments (they remain optional to match Moto’s examples).
`mock_aws_decorator`
is also exported for teams that prefer an explicitly decorator-only name (or want
to preconfigure `reset` / `remove_data` once and reuse it) while leaving `mock_aws`
for context-manager usage.

```python
import boto3
from aiobotocore.session import AioSession
from aiomoto import mock_aws, mock_aws_decorator


@mock_aws
def test_sync_bucket() -> None:
    client = boto3.client("s3", region_name="us-east-1")
    client.create_bucket(Bucket="decorator-demo")


@mock_aws_decorator
async def test_async_bucket() -> None:
    async with AioSession().create_client("s3", region_name="us-east-1") as client:
        await client.create_bucket(Bucket="decorator-demo")
```

### Use as a context manager

```python
import boto3
from aiobotocore.session import AioSession
from aiomoto import mock_aws

async def demo():
    async with mock_aws():
        s3_sync = boto3.client("s3", region_name="us-east-1")
        s3_sync.create_bucket(Bucket="example")

        session = AioSession()
        async with session.create_client("s3", region_name="us-east-1") as s3_async:
            result = await s3_async.list_buckets()
            assert any(b["Name"] == "example" for b in result["Buckets"])
```

While aiomoto is active in in-process mode it prevents aiobotocore from issuing real
HTTP calls; any attempts fall back to Moto and will raise if they escape the
stubber. Avoid mixing raw Moto decorators with aiomoto contexts in the same test to
keep state aligned.

Server mode can also attach to an existing server by passing a `server_port`.
This keeps the context in “client mode” (no server start/stop) while still
injecting the endpoint. When aiomoto starts a server it records a registry file
under `AIOMOTO_SERVER_REGISTRY_DIR` and exposes the path via
`ctx.server_registry_path`.

Registry files use the pattern
`${AIOMOTO_SERVER_REGISTRY_DIR}/aiomoto-server-<uuid>.json`
and contain payloads like:

```json
{
  "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:12345",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "pid": 1234,
  "port": 12345
}
```

Registry entries older than 24 hours are treated as stale and cleaned up when a
new server is started.

### Server mode example

```python
import boto3
from aiomoto import AutoEndpointMode, mock_aws


def test_server_mode_force() -> None:
    with mock_aws(server_mode=True) as ctx:
        client = boto3.client("s3")
        assert client.meta.endpoint_url == ctx.server_endpoint
        client.create_bucket(Bucket="server-mode")


def test_server_mode_if_missing() -> None:
    with mock_aws(server_mode=True, auto_endpoint=AutoEndpointMode.IF_MISSING):
        client = boto3.client("s3", endpoint_url="http://example.com")
        assert client.meta.endpoint_url == "http://example.com"


def test_server_mode_disabled() -> None:
    with mock_aws(server_mode=True, auto_endpoint=AutoEndpointMode.DISABLED) as ctx:
        client = boto3.client("s3", endpoint_url=ctx.server_endpoint)
        client.create_bucket(Bucket="server-mode-explicit")


def test_server_mode_attach() -> None:
    with mock_aws(server_mode=True) as server:
        port = server.server_port
        assert port is not None
        # In another process, pass server_port to reuse the existing server.
        with mock_aws(server_mode=True, server_port=port) as client:
            assert client.server_endpoint == server.server_endpoint
```

### Pandas S3 in server mode

```python
import boto3
import pandas as pd
from aiomoto import mock_aws


def test_pandas_server_mode_csv() -> None:
    df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["x", "y"]})
    path = "s3://pandas-bucket/data.csv"

    with mock_aws(server_mode=True):
        boto3.client("s3").create_bucket(Bucket="pandas-bucket")
        # aiomoto patches pandas + fsspec/s3fs so s3:// routes to Moto.
        df.to_csv(path, index=False)
        result = pd.read_csv(path)

    assert result.equals(df)
```

Requires pandas + fsspec + s3fs for S3 access (pyarrow for parquet). You can
install the pinned pandas extra via `aiomoto[pandas]`.

### s3fs example

```python
import s3fs
from aiomoto import mock_aws


def test_s3fs_sync_usage() -> None:
    with mock_aws():
        fs = s3fs.S3FileSystem(asynchronous=False, anon=False)
        fs.call_s3("create_bucket", Bucket="bucket-123")
        fs.call_s3("put_object", Bucket="bucket-123", Key="test.txt", Body=b"hi")
        assert fs.cat("bucket-123/test.txt") == b"hi"
```

### DynamoDB example

```python
import boto3
from aiobotocore.session import AioSession
from aiomoto import mock_aws

AWS_REGION = "us-west-2"

async def demo():
    with mock_aws():
        # Sync write
        ddb_sync = boto3.client("dynamodb", region_name=AWS_REGION)
        ddb_sync.create_table(
            TableName="items",
            KeySchema=[{"AttributeName": "pk", "KeyType": "HASH"}],
            AttributeDefinitions=[{"AttributeName": "pk", "AttributeType": "S"}],
            BillingMode="PAY_PER_REQUEST",
        )
        ddb_sync.put_item(TableName="items", Item={"pk": {"S": "from-sync"}})

        # Async read (aiobotocore)
        async with AioSession().create_client(
            "dynamodb", region_name=AWS_REGION
        ) as ddb_async:
            item = await ddb_async.get_item(
                TableName="items", Key={"pk": {"S": "from-sync"}}
            )
            assert item["Item"]["pk"]["S"] == "from-sync"
```

## Roadmap

The living roadmap sits in the wiki [Roadmap](https://github.com/owenlamont/aiomoto/wiki/Roadmap)

## Limitations

- Mixing raw Moto decorators with `aiomoto.mock_aws` in the same test is unsupported;
  the contexts manage shared state differently and can diverge.
- aiomoto wraps moto and patches aiobotocore; aioboto3 and s3fs should be covered
  automatically as they use aiobotocore clients/resources.
- We keep version ranges narrow and tested together, if you notice a new version of
  aiobotocore or moto that doesn't get covered feel free to raise an issue for this.
- s3fs caches filesystem instances; create them inside `mock_aws` and close them so
  finalizers don’t hit a closed or different event loop.
- Pandas S3 I/O: in server mode, aiomoto patches pandas to route `s3://` through
  fsspec/s3fs when those dependencies are installed.
- Polars S3 I/O is patched in server mode when polars is installed; aiomoto
  injects `storage_options` for `s3://` paths following the `auto_endpoint` mode.
