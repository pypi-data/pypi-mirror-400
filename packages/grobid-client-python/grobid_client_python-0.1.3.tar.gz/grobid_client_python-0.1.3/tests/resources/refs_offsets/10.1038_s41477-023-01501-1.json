        "text": "Although many studies have shown that microbes can ectopically stimulate or suppress plant immune responses, the fundamental question of whether the entire preexisting microbiota is indeed required for proper development of plant immune response remains unanswered. Using a recently developed peat-based gnotobiotic plant growth system, we found that Arabidopsis grown in the absence of a natural microbiota lacked age-dependent maturation of plant immune response and were defective in several aspects of pattern-triggered immunity. Axenic plants exhibited hypersusceptibility to infection by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Microbiota-mediated immunocompetence was suppressed by rich nutrient conditions, indicating a tripartite interaction between the host, microbiota and abiotic environment. A synthetic microbiota composed of 48 culturable bacterial strains from the leaf endosphere of healthy Arabidopsis plants was able to substantially restore immunocompetence similar to plants inoculated with a soil-derived community. In contrast, a 52-member dysbiotic synthetic leaf microbiota overstimulated the immune transcriptome. Together, these results provide evidence for a causal role of a eubiotic microbiota in gating proper immunocompetence and age-dependent immunity in plants.",

        "text": "The aboveground and belowground parts of land plants host a variety of microorganisms, which collectively constitute the plant microbiota. Microbiota members can reside on or inside plants and appear to be taxonomically conserved at the phylum level [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] . The broad conservation of plant microbiota suggests that plants probably have evolved mechanisms to select and maintain the abundance, composition and function of microbiota to achieve homoeostasis 9 . A correctly assembled microbiota (that is, eubiotic microbiota) is probably essential for plant health and survival as recent studies have begun to reveal deleterious effects of genetically induced dysbiotic microbiotas on plant health [10][11][12][13] . Although individual or groups of members of the microbiota have been shown to improve nutrient uptake, growth and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses 1,2,[14][15][16] , the contribution of a plant's entire indigenous microbiota to plant functions is not well understood. This is largely due to poorly dissected microbe-microbe and microbe-plant interactions at the community level.",

In 2.5-week-old plants, we observed a modest level of flg22-mediated resistance to virulent Pst DC3000 in flg22-treated plants compared with mock-treated plants. Older, 3.5-week-old plants, however, exhibited a significantly enhanced level of flg22-triggered resistance compared with 2.5-week-old plants (Fig. 1a).

We examined an additional hypothesis that the endogenous microbiome might be involved in age-dependent PTI in plants. For this purpose, we investigated the temporal maturation of flg22-mediated resistance in peat-based gnotobiotic plant growth systems. Holoxenic (HO) plants colonized with a natural, soil-derived microbial community ('MSU', collected from agricultural soil located at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan; see Methods) and corresponding axenic (AX) plants, which were mock inoculated with autoclaved 'microbial community derived from the same 'MSU' soil', were used. As shown in Fig. 1b,c, HO plants exhibited progressively more robust flg22-mediated resistance against Pst DC3000 over time, which is consistent with age-dependent PTI observed in plants grown conventionally in potting soil (Fig. 1a). In contrast, AX plants mock-inoculated with the autoclaved microbial community were greatly reduced in age-dependent flg22-mediated resistance phenotype (Fig. 1b,c). Arabidopsis mutant bak1-5 bkk1-1 cerk1 (bbc) (ref. 46), which is defective in PTI signalling downstream of multiple PRRs, including the flg22 receptor FLS2, did not show flg22-mediated resistance in HO plants at any age (Extended Data Fig. 1), suggesting that microbiota-mediated age-dependent resistance requires canonical PTI signalling co-receptors.",

Interestingly, basal expression of FRK1 was lower in AX plants compared with either young or old HO plants (Fig. 1d) and, notably, no significant age-dependent increase in flg22-induced FRK1 expression was observed in AX plants (Fig. 1e).

To reduce the possibility of community-specific bias due to the use of a single microbiota, microbial communities collected from two distinct soils were used: 'MSU', which was collected as Alfisol soil type, and 'Malaka', which was collected from undisturbed grassland soil in Malaka Township, Iowa (see Methods) and is a Mollisol soil. Principal component analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq gene expression data revealed distinct expression patterns between HO plants and AX plants (PC1, 26% variance; Fig. 2a). Using |log 2 FC| ≥ 1 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 cut-off, we identified a total of 435 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HO and AX plants across both microbiota inputs: 352 were depleted in AX plants and 83 were enriched in AX plants (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Data 1). Of the 352 DEGs depleted in AX plants, 138 were depleted irrespective of the microbiota input source (that is, enriched in both HO plants colonized by the 'MSU' community and HO plants against potentially harmful exploitations by microorganisms, plants have evolved cell surface and intracellular immune receptors that recognize evolutionarily conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or pathogen-derived effector proteins, resulting in pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) or effector-triggered immunity (ETI), respectively. While ETI appears to be specific for pathogens, PTI represents a basal line of plant defence against both pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes and is required for maintaining a eubiotic phyllosphere microbiota in Arabidopsis to prevent dysbiosis 10,11 . PTI signalling is initiated upon perception of PAMPs by plasma membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) 17 . For example, a 22-amino-acid epitope derived from bacterial flagellin (flg22) is a well characterized elicitor of PTI and is recognized by the PRR FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE 2 (FLS2) (ref. 18). FLS2 forms a complex with co-receptor BRASSINOS-TEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1) (ref. 19). Phosphorelays between FLS2, BAK1, BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) and a MAPK cascade initiate downstream PTI signalling events, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium fluxes, expression of a large suite of defence-related genes, cell wall remodelling and stomatal closure [20][21][22][23][24][25] . Activation of PTI before an infection can also result in enhanced pathogen resistance 26,27 .",

      "text": "Age-related resistance (ARR) is a widely observed phenomenon in plants in which young plants exhibit greater disease susceptibility compared with older plants 28,29 . This is observed across many flowering plants against a variety of pathogens 30 . In Arabidopsis, for instance, the basal susceptibility of young plants to the foliar bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 is greater compared with older plants 31 . One hypothesis to explain ARR involves the growth-defence trade-off concept: to balance resource allocations during vigorous vegetative growth early in life, young plants prioritize growth over defence 32,33 . Indeed, there is evidence of direct molecular connections between plant growth and immunity [34][35][36] , including common dual-function signalling components as in the case of PTI and brassinosteroid-dependent plant growth 37 . However, it is unclear whether molecular connections such as these are a sole basis for ARR in plants. In the animal kingdom, development of gnotobiotic animals such as germ-free mice led researchers to discover an important contribution of endogenous microbiota in postnatal maturation of innate immune responses in newborn animals 38,39 . This raises the possibility that plant microbiota may also contribute to the maturation of plant immunity. However, it remains an open question whether age-dependent immunity is entirely intrinsic to plant development or whether maturation of PTI is, in part, the result of colonization of a microbiota. Furthermore, in animals, the presence of dysbiotic microbial communities can be linked to exaggerated immune responses, which have debilitating clinical consequences 40 . Genetically induced and naturally occurring dysbiotic microbial communities have recently been described in plants 10,41,42 , but it is not clear whether dysbiotic microbiota in plants are associated with overactive immune responses. Addressing these basic microbiome questions requires the development of proper gnotobiotic plant growth systems and establishment of well characterized normal (eubiotic) and dysbiotic microbial communities.",

Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of these 138 'core' AX-depleted genes revealed an over-representation of terms involved in plant immunity (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Data 2). The genes enriched in AX plants did not display any significant GO term enrichment. Closer examination of depleted DEGs in AX plants revealed numerous genes involved in PTI, defence hormone salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defence and defence-associated metabolite biosynthesis (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 1). These genes included FRK1; several leucine-rich repeat protein kinases such as IMPAIRED OOMYCETE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (IOS1), AT1G51890, AT1G51790, AT1G51860 and AT5G59680; systemic immunity-associated genes AZELAIC ACID INDUCED 1 (AZI1) and AZI3; PATHOGENESIS RELATED 2 (PR2) and PR4; glucosinolate biosynthesis genes such as FAD-LINKED OXIDOREDUCTASE (FOX1) and the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP71A12 and CYP71B15; and defence-associated transcription factors MYB15 and WRKY 30 (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 1). Thus, consistent with the targeted FRK1 gene expression analysis shown in Fig. 1d, results from the transcriptome analysis using two independent soil-derived microbiotas pointed to a broadly depleted PTI/SA defence gene expression in AX plants compared with HO plants, which collectively contribute to induced and basal innate immunity.",

For example, 6-week-old AX plants exhibited significantly reduced flg22-, elf18-and Pep1-induced ROS production compared with HO plants both in the magnitude of maximum ROS production (peak amplitude) and in the time to reach the maximum (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 2). AX plants also exhibited significantly reduced PAMP/DAMP-induced FRK1 gene expression compared with HO plants (Fig. 3b). Western blot analysis revealed that despite possessing similar levels of total MPK3 and MPK6 (Fig. 3c,d), less MPK was phosphorylated in AX plants after the activation of PTI by treatment with flg22 (Fig. 3e). Although reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis consistently showed that both basal and flg22-induced expression of the FLS2 receptor gene is significantly reduced in AX plant leaf tissue compared with HO plant leaf tissue (Fig. 3f), total FLS2 protein abundance was variable and only occasionally reduced in AX plant leaves (Extended Data Fig. 3). In contrast, the co-receptor BAK1 protein was consistently found in lower relative abundance in AX plants compared with HO plants (Fig. 3g). In addition, quantification of the defence hormone SA, which is downstream of PTI signalling, revealed that AX plants possess lower basal levels of SA compared with HO plants (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Finally, AX plants were hypersensitive to infection by the virulent foliar hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000 and the necrotrophic fungal pathogen B. cinerea compared with HO plants (Fig. 3h,i).

To determine to what extent an eubiotic SynCom derived from the leaf endosphere could restore immunocompetence to AX plants, we compared the PTI phenotypes of Col-0 plants grown with and without SynCom (SynCom Col-0 vs MgCl 2 ). Col-0 plants grown with the 'MSU' soil-derived microbiota were used as control. We observed robust flg22-induced production of ROS in HO plants inoculated with the 'MSU' soil-derived microbiota and SynCom Col-0 -inoculated plants (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 5a). We next quantified flg22-induced FRK1 gene expression and observed that plants colonized by SynCom Col-0 were restored in basal and flg22-induced FRK1 expression (Fig. 4b,c), which was again similar to that observed for HO plants (Fig. 1d,e). In addition, plants colonized by SynCom Col-0 had an increased level of BAK1 protein (Extended Data Fig. 5b) and were more resistant to Pst DC3000 infection (Fig. 4d) compared with AX plants mock-inoculated with the same volume of 10 mM MgCl 2 . Taken together, these results suggest that a leaf endosphere-derived bacterial SynCom can substantially restore immune competence to AX plants similar to a natural soil-derived microbiota. To evaluate possible redundancy of SynCom Col-0 members in contribution to immune competence, we assembled a simplified version of SynCom Col-0 with only 19 strains (SynCom ) to cover the taxonomic diversity at the genus level (Supplementary Data 3). We found that SynCom Col-mix19 could effectively restore ROS production in response to flg22 (Extended Data Fig. 6). Furthermore, among strains with high representation in SynCom Col-0 , we randomly chose a mix of three strains that are present in SynCom Col-mix19 and found that these three strains (SynCom Col-mix3 , representing Achromobacter, Comamonas and Stenotrophomonas genera) also partially restored ROS production in response to flg22 (Extended Data Fig. 6). This suggests that there might be significant redundancy among strains of SynCom Col-0 that can endow immunocompetence.",

To systematically determine the effects of nutrients on microbiota-mediated immunocompetence, we measured flg22-induced production of ROS in AX and HO plants along a nutrient concentration gradient.

We observed a significant impact of nutrients on flg22-mediated ROS production in HO plants. Decreasing nutrient strength significantly increased ROS burst magnitude and shortened time to reach the maximum ROS production (Fig. 5a) in HO plants. At intermediate nutrient levels (0.5x LS), ROS burst magnitude was moderately increased and time to reach the maximum was reduced compared with higher (1x LS) nutrient concentrations, but the total ROS produced was not significantly different (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 7a).

Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota and Gammaproteobactera (belonging to the order Pseudomonadales) were observed to be more abundant in the phyllosphere of plants grown with 0.5x LS, whereas their relative abundance was greatly reduced in plants grown with 1x LS.

      "text": "It should be pointed out that the discovery of a causal role of microbiota in age-dependent immune maturation required the use of a gnotobiotic system capable of growing plants with or without a natural or synthetic community of microbes. Because agar plates, a commonly used gnotobiotic system, are not ideal for natural colonization of plants by a complex microbial community due to artificial overgrowth of some microbes, this has been achieved in this study by using Flow-Pot and GnotoPot gnotobiotic systems with a peat-based substrate, which partially simulates the natural soil substrate. We used FlowPots and GnotoPots interchangeably and some initial experiments were repeated using both systems with similar results. For most subsequent experiments, we used GnotoPots because they allowed plants to grow for a longer duration compared with FlowPots 43 . An important realization during this study is that peat-based plant gnotobiotic systems can be fine-tuned to simulate a range of various abiotic conditions, such as nutrients. This was useful for our study because many of the microbiota functions in nature seem to be context dependent. For example, high nitrogen fertilizer regimes have been shown to increase susceptibility of plants grown in a non-sterile hydroponic system 49 . However, it was not known whether the effect of high-nitrogen nutrients is mediated in part by microbiota. In this study, fine-tuning the nutrient conditions of GnotoPots enabled us to discover that nutrient-mediated immune suppression was most obvious in the presence of microbiota and that high nitrogen has a prominent effect on microbiota level and composition, suggesting an intricate interplay between plant, microbiota and nutrient conditions.",

      "text": "Recent studies began to illustrate the importance of immunitymicrobiome interplays in plants. For example, we and others have recently shown that PTI-associated PRRs and ROS-generating RBOHD/F are essential components of a plant genetic network in configuring a normal eubiotic leaf microbiota to prevent health-damaging dysbiosis 1,10,11 . Similarly, bacterial members of both leaf and root microbiotas either stimulate or suppress PTI-associated gene expression 50,51 . In this study, we found that a synthetic community composed of 48 culturable Arabidopsis phyllosphere bacteria (SynCom Col-0 ) was sufficient to restore immunocompetence in the leaves of AX plants at a level similar to that conferred by a natural soil-derived microbial community. This is interesting considering that most members of the leaf bacterial microbiota live on the surfaces and less than 5% of leaf bacteria reside inside the leaves 10 . Results presented here suggest either the importance of endophytic leaf bacteria in maturing immune responses in Arabidopsis leaves or the presence of multiple functionally redundant subcommunities of any given microbiota, with each subcommunity capable of independently conferring immune maturation to plants. In either scenario, there seems to be substantial redundancy among different phyllosphere strains in endowing immunocompetence (Extended Data Fig. 6). The role of microbiota in modulating immunocompetence seems robust across different plant growth conditions used in our study. When we analysed the transcriptome profiles of plants colonized by SynCom Col-0 vs natural microbiota (HO Malaka or HO MSU ), compared to the corresponding axenic plants, enrichment of immune-associated genes was observed in both cases (Extended Data Fig. 9), even though plants were grown under different conditions, including different growth-substrate mixtures and photoperiods (see Methods). Interestingly, enriched immune genes observed in our study include 20 so-called 'general non-self response (GNSR)' genes that are commonly induced by 13 individual strains from the At-LSPHERE collection 52 . The GNSR genes constitute 9% of the upregulated genes (20/213) commonly enriched in plants inoculated with natural microbiotas and SynCom Col-0 in this study. Overall, our study is consistent with the existence of a broader core microbiota-associated transcriptome response and highlights the importance of a natural or eubiotic community in shaping the transcriptome landscape of basal immune responses in plants.",

      "text": "Another important implication of the findings from this study is that not only do Arabidopsis plants require a microbiota to properly develop PTI, but also that the composition of the microbiota is important. We found that SynCom Col-0 , a eubiotic microbiota derived from healthy Arabidopsis leaves, was sufficient to restore immunocompetence to AX plants. In contrast, SynCom mfec , a dysbiotic microbiota derived from leaves of the Arabidopsis mfec quadruple mutant, overstimulated immune gene expression (Fig. 6). This observation suggests that a healthy, eubiotic microbiota is necessary to properly gate the plant immune system. We think that this is an important observation because in human-microbiome interactions, dysbiosis is associated with autoimmune ailments such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, allergies and other health issues 53,54 . Thus, an intimate interplay between immunity and microbiota appears to be core to host-microbiome interactions in both animal and plant kingdoms. Deviations from a eubiotic microbiota could result in immunodeficiency (as in the case of AX plants) or immune overstimulation (as in the case of SynCom mfec -inoculated plants). Thus, a eubiotic microbiota has a fundamental role in gating plant immune response during growth and development.",

Samples were extracted overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The next day, samples were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE membrane (Millipore, UFC30LG25) and transferred to autosampler vials. Injections (10 μl) of prepared extracts were separated using an Ascentis Express fused-core C18 column (2.1 × 50 m, 2.7 μm) heated to 50 °C on an Acquity ultra performance liquid chromatography system (Waters Corporation). A gradient of 0.15% formic acid in water (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) was applied over 2.5 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min -1 . Separation consisted of a linear increase from A:B (49:1) to 100% B.
