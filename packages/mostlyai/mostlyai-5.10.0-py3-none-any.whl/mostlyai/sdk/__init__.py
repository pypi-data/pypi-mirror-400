"""Synthetic Data SDK - Python toolkit for high-fidelity, privacy-safe synthetic data.

The SDK supports two operating modes:
- LOCAL mode: Train and generate synthetic data locally on your own compute resources
- CLIENT mode: Connect to a remote MOSTLY AI platform for training & generation

Key Resources
-------------
The SDK manages four core resources:

1. **Generators** - Train synthetic data generators on tabular or language data
2. **Synthetic Datasets** - Create synthetic samples from trained generators
3. **Connectors** - Connect to data sources (databases, cloud storage)
4. **Datasets** - Create datasets with instructions (CLIENT mode only)

Core Operations
---------------
- `mostly.train(config)` - Train a generator on tabular or language data
- `mostly.generate(g, config)` - Generate synthetic data records
- `mostly.probe(g, config)` - Live probe the generator on demand
- `mostly.connect(config)` - Connect to external data sources

Key Features
------------
- Broad data support (mixed-type, single/multi-table, time-series)
- Multiple model types (TabularARGN, Hugging Face LLMs, LSTM)
- Advanced training options (GPU/CPU, Differential Privacy)
- Automated quality assurance with metrics and HTML reports
- Flexible sampling (up-sampling, conditional simulation, rebalancing)
- Seamless integration with external data sources
