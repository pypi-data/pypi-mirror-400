    The `Matcher` module is designed to evaluate spatial relationships between objects, such as determining whether one object is contained within another or whether two objects intersect.

    For example, to create and use Matcher it can be used like this:
    ```
    from modlib.apps import Matcher

    matcher = Matcher()
    ...
    people = detections[detections.class_id == 0]
