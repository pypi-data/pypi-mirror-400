Consequently, the aim of the present study was to characterise the functional relationship of checkpoints and prediction errors in a serial pattern detection task using electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, we first hypothesised a joint P3b component of both event classes to index recourse to the internal model (compared to non-informative standards, STD). Second, we assumed the mismatch signal of PE to be reflected in an N400 component when compared to CP. Event-related findings supported these hypotheses. We suggest that while model adaptation is instigated by prediction errors, checkpoints are similarly used for model evaluation. Intriguingly, behavioural subgroup analyses showed that the exploitation of potentially informative reference points may depend on initial cue learning: Strict reliance on cue-based predictions may result in less attentive processing of these reference points, thus impeding upregulation of response gain that would prompt flexible model adaptation. Overall, present results highlight the role of checkpoints as modelcompliant, informative reference points and stimulate important research questions about their processing as function of learning und uncertainty.",

      "text": "Predicting upcoming events constitutes one of the fundamental qualities of brain function. Based on internal models shaped by previous experience, top-down predictions are compared to bottom-up sensory signals [1]. Redundant components of perceptual information are disregarded whereas surprising expectancy violations are propagated upward in the processing hierarchy [2][3]. Model adaptation in consequence of such prediction errors (PE) has been proposed to be the foundation of associative learning mechanisms [4][5], as unexpected events are particularly informative with regard to their current context. Importantly, probabilistically occurring expected events have also been suggested to inform the internal model [6]: While PE instigate model adaptation, expected events verify model-based predictions. These verifications are particularly informative when we face uncertain environments. A recent fMRI study [7] found that in uncertain environments, so-called checkpoints (CP) emerged as points in time where distinctive processing of expected events pointed to a context-sensitive adaptation in predictive processing. While the entire stimulus sequence could be predicted reliably in stable environments, unstable environments prompted stepwise predictions. This way, CP were used to verify the internal model in order to predict the next section accordingly. Thus, while model adaptation is induced by prediction errors, context-dependent model evaluation does not seem to require expectancy violations. Instead, selected time points carry information about the on-line validity of the internal model, raising the intriguing question of how checkpoints and prediction errors functionally relate to one another.",

Expectable sequence length was cued by digit colour and occasionally violated by premature terminations or unexpected extensions. In addition to these two types of prediction errors, checkpoints were defined as sequential positions where PE could potentially occur, but did not. Thus, although checkpoints were exclusively sampled from regular events consistent with the previous cue, their occurrence was probabilistically modulated by blockwise manipulation of irreducible uncertainty. Irreducible uncertainty refers to uncertainty that cannot be reduced further and remains even after successful (i.e., ideal) learning [8][9]. Going back to our research question, both checkpoints and prediction errors provide central information for model evaluation or adaptation, respectively, whereas deterministic standard trials (STD) did neither. Consequently, we first hypothesised a joint event-related (ERP) component of CP and PE (compared to STD) reflecting recourse to the internal model. The P3b component has been conclusively shown to co-vary with subjective improbability or unexpectedness of a stimulus [10][11][12]. Such highly informative events supposedly initiate contextual updating [13][14] or memory-based revision of mental representations [15]. Importantly, the P3b is elicited by behaviourally relevant rather than merely deviant stimuli in order to facilitate motor responses [16][17], making it a promising candidate for a joint physiological component of checkpoints and prediction errors.",

N400 is elicited by a multitude of sensory events and its amplitude is known to scale with event surprise in language [18][19], recognition memory (reviewed in [20]), and arithmetic tasks [21][22], presumably marking modality-independent integration of incongruous information. More generally, N400 has been discussed as a modality-independent index of representations needing revision in light of expectancy violations (for review, see [11]). Consequently, we hypothesised an enhanced N400 component for highly surprising, model-incongruent PE to reflect this mismatch signal in contrast to expectation-compliant CP: While information from both event types has to be integrated into existing model structures, the excess effort of integrating prediction error information should result in a more pronounced N400 component.",

We assessed two additional questions with regard to more specific distinctions in behaviour: First, we hypothesised the gain group to more frequently respond prematurely to extended sequences, i.e. at the 'would-be' end of the sequence had it not been extended (see Fig 1B). Recall that unexpected extensions occurred at the sequential positions where-based on the cue information-a non-sequential digit was expected. Accordingly, as illustrated in Fig 4, we compared the two groups' button releases within the interval of -1000 (onset of the unexpected sequential digit) and 500 ms (offset of the first non-sequential digit) around the end of extended sequences. Supporting our hypothesis, the gain group was found to have a significantly higher number of releases within the [-1000, 500] ms time frame than the no gain group (t(15) = 22.28, p < .001, one-sided; see Fig 4A).

The gain group could therefore be expected to more frequently release the response button within a brief interval of ± 500 ms around the end of regular sequences. Responses during the last sequential digit (i.e. offset latency between -500 and 0 ms) would reflect an anticipatory release of the response button whereas responses during the first non-sequential digit (0-500 ms) would reflect a quick detection of the sequence end. Both anticipatory and quick releases after the end of a regular sequence were hypothesised to be positively associated with the degree to which the colour-length association had been learned.

Often discussed as an index of enhanced information transmission and allocation of resources [33][34], P3b is well suited to reflect exploitation of information at these sequential positions. More precisely, an incoming stimulus is evaluated in context of previous stimuli by comparing it to information from working memory [35][36]. Such monitoring is immediately beneficial for stimulus classification and-where required-transforming this information into action [37][38]. These proposals fit well with central findings from the original fMRI study in which we found enhanced activation at checkpoints under high (vs low) contextual uncertainty. We interpreted these effects as an iterant evaluation of model information retrieved from working memory, pointing towards a strategic adaptation of predictive processing to contextual statistics [7]. Notably, the observed activation pattern included the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), a hypothesised cortical source of the P3b [39]. Common ERP components and the similarities in functional microstates thus further illuminate the processing of CP and PE as highly informative events, suggesting that positions of potential and actual prediction errors are being exploited in a similar way.",

      "text": "It remains the key difference between checkpoints and prediction errors that only the latter violated cue-based predictions. Therefore, despite the similarities reported above, CP and PE will eventually be processed differently once consequences of the actual stimulus come into effect. Supporting our initial hypothesis, the mismatch signal for PE (vs CP) was reflected in an N400 component. N400 effects have typically been reported when words mismatched semantic expectations shaped by previous context information (e.g., [40]). Closely related to the present paradigm, centro-parietal N400 effects following incorrect (vs correct) solutions in arithmetic tasks (e.g., [41]) point towards a more general process independent of stimulus modality. Accordingly, Kutas & Federmeier [11] discuss the N400 as an index of conceptual representations which-when contextually induced predictions are violated-may need to be refined. Such adaptive processes are conceivably reflected by components occurring even later than the PE-related N400, e.g., ERPs related to subsequent digits 'confirming' the initially surprising stimulus. Future research could make use of later time frames to further distinguish prediction errors and checkpoints with regard to the respective consequences they entail. To summarise, checkpoints are informative points in time which, despite a lack of unexpected input, show close functional similarities to canonical prediction errors. Our findings suggest that information from particular sequential positions, irrespective of the actual outcome, is used for evaluation and/or updating of internal models. Importantly, while sensory input at CP complied with the more likely expectation, their sequential positions were tagged by the statistical structure inherent in the stimulus stream. Previous fMRI results have shown CP to be exploited particularly in highly uncertain contexts, conceivably in order to solve ambiguity with regard to upcoming sensory information and efficiently adapt behaviour. Overall, the functional profile of checkpoints conceptually relates to bottleneck states [42][43] from the realm of hierarchical reinforcement learning. Bottleneck states form natural subgoals in hierarchical representations of behaviour [44][45]. For example, when trying to find the kitchen in a friend's house, certain features like doors and stairways operate as bottlenecks informing the search [42]. Consequently, bottlenecks are conceptualised as transition points between larger sets of representational states. Similarly, on a more abstract level, the sequential positions of CP and PE mark informative transition points between predictable and non-predictable (random) states. Depending on whether or not the presented stimulus complied with cue-based expectations, checkpoints and prediction errors are supposedly used for model evaluation and updating, respectively.",

On a broader scale, this suggests overlapping roles of CP and PE in predictive processing. Given that error-based model updating has been established to be fundamental for associative learning [46], CP could similarly be used for model evaluation. Clearly, expectation-compliant information (as observed at checkpoints) does not call for corrective model updating. It seems unlikely, however, that potentially critical information extracted from CP would not be used to evaluate the validity of model statistics on-line. Particularly for the estimation of higher level statistics, the number of regular outcomes at critical time points is no less instructive than the number of prediction errors. Support for this proposition comes from earlier studies using digit sequences in abstract predictive processing. Ku ¨hn and Schubotz [6] found a distinct frontal correlate of regular, model-compliant events at sequential positions where statistically rare breaches of expectancy had previously been observed. As the actual sensory input neither violated model-based predictions nor called for behavioural adaptation, these frontal responses reflected increased weight of bottom-up signals driving potential model updating solely based on statistical regularities. Another study manipulated the requirement to either ignore or respond to two different expectation violations [47]. Again, violations that could be ignored ('drifts') did confirm the internal model, whereas violations that required a response ('switches') prompted corrective model updating. The pattern of brain activation suggested a two-step neural response to these events, starting with joint processing of stimulus discrimination followed by distinct correlates of behavioural responses prompted by the respective violation type.",

      "text": "In addition to effects of context uncertainty, behavioural subgroup analyses suggested inter-individual differences in cue learning as a determining factor for CP/PE processing: The more strongly participants had learned the cue-length association, the more often they showed early responses at the end of a sequence. Depending on which sequence was observed, this response pattern had diverging implications on behavioural efficiency: In case of regular sequences, early releases during the last sequential digit showed how strong anticipation of the sequence ending spurred fast and efficient responses. Critically, however, the very same anticipation led some participants to erroneously respond at the 'would-be' end of extended sequences. One explanation could be that (overly) successful cue learning triggered a consistent prediction of sequence length (\"Five digits after green\") irrespective of context-dependent violations. This way, information from checkpoints (in regular sequences) or prediction errors (in extended sequences) would not be exploited, as indicated by the negative correlation between event-specific surprise and offset latency. Overall, these results suggest that participants with increased knowledge of cueing information strongly (and sometimes falsely) relied on these initial cues, virtually disregarding potentially informative transition points during the sequence. In other words, excess reliance on cue information led to less attention being given to these transition points. More formalised accounts of predictive processing have postulated attention to control the involvement of prior expectations at different levels [48]. Specifically, attention is conceptualised as a means to increase the weight (or gain) of neural responses coding error signals, making them more eligible to drive learning and potential behavioural adjustments. Strict adherence to cue information conceivably impedes allocating attentional resources to CP/PE time points and, consequently, model adaptation. One promising direction for future studies would thus be to specifically vary training exposure between groups and assess the interplay of bottom-up and top-down dynamics underlying CP/PE processing.",

To this end, one central direction for studies currently in preparation is to reduce the number of prediction error types, effectively ensuring equal behavioural relevance of all checkpoints. Furthermore, some caution is required when interpreting ERPs elicited by events of naturally varying presentation frequencies.

Relatedly, the microstate analyses presented here motivate a more in-depth multivariate assessment of STD, CP, and PE representations, extending our understanding of similarities and differences between them. For example, STD trials should be reliably discriminable from CP and PE already during the pre-stimulus period, reflecting the anticipation of task-relevant information that can be obtained from the latter. Thus, representations of CP and PE should be similar during the pre-stimulus period but distinct during later periods reflecting actual outcome processing.

(B) Similarly, shown here for a short regular sequence (length of 5 digits), the gain group was found to release the response button more frequently at offset latencies between -500 and +500 ms (i.e. between the onset of the last sequential digit and the offset of the first nonsequential digit) following regular sequences. Dotted lines and bars depict mean offset latencies for extended sequences per group ± 2 SEM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0218311.g004",
