    - query: "    Question: A cycled from P to Q at 10 kmph and returned at the rate of 9 kmph. B cycled both ways at 12 kmph. In the whole journey B took 10 minutes less than A. Find the distance between P and Q. \nOptions: \nA. 1.75km\nB. 2.75km\nC. 3.75km\nD. 4.75km\nE. 5.75km\n"
      explanation: "A -time = d/10 + d/9 = 19d/90 hours\nB -time = 2d/12 = d/6 hours\n10 min = 1/6 hours\nThus 19d/90 - d/6 = 1/6\n(19d-15d)/90 = 1/6\n4d/90 = 1/6\nthus d= 15/4 km = 3.75km. The answer is (C)."

      explanation: "R.F=Raj's father age\nR=Raj's age\nR.M=Raj's mother age\n(R.F+4)=2*(R+4)\n(R.M-2)=2*(R-2)\nR+8=32\nTherefore, R=24\nTherefore, R.M=46\nTherefore, R.F=52\nR.F + R.M = 98\\. The answer is (B)."
