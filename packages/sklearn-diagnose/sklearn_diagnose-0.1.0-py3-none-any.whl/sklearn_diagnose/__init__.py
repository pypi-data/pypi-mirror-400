"""
sklearn-diagnose: An intelligent diagnosis layer for scikit-learn.

LLM-powered model failure detection with evidence-based analysis.

This library uses LLM-powered analysis for model diagnosis. All hypotheses 
are probabilistic and evidence-based.

Cross-validation interpretation is a core signal extractor within 
sklearn-diagnose, used to detect instability, overfitting, and potential 
data leakage.

Quick Start:
    >>> from sklearn_diagnose import setup_llm, diagnose
    >>> 
    >>> setup_llm(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o", api_key="sk-...")
    >>> 
    >>> report = diagnose(
    ...     estimator=model,
    ...     datasets={
    ...         "train": (X_train, y_train),
    ...         "val": (X_val, y_val)
    ...     },
    ...     task="classification"
    ... )
    >>> 
    >>> print(report.summary())
    >>> print(report.recommendations)

The library follows an LLM-driven architecture:
1. Signal extraction: Compute deterministic statistics from the model
2. LLM hypothesis generation: Detect failure modes with confidence/severity
3. LLM recommendation generation: Generate actionable recommendations
4. LLM summary generation: Create human-readable summaries

Read-Only Guarantee:
    This library NEVER modifies your estimator, never calls fit(),
    and never mutates your input data.

Detected Failure Modes:
    - Overfitting
    - Underfitting
    - High variance
    - Label noise
    - Feature redundancy
    - Class imbalance
    - Data leakage (suspicious patterns)

LLM Setup (required):
    >>> from sklearn_diagnose import setup_llm
    >>> setup_llm(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o", api_key="sk-...")
