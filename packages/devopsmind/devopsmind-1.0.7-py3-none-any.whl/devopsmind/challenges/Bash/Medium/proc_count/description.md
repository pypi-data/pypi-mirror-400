Create a script named `count_procs.sh` that prints ONLY the number of running processes on the system.

Requirements:
- The output must be numeric (digits only), no extra text.
- Use standard tools (`ps`, `pgrep`, etc.). Avoid counting header lines.
- Script must be executable.
- This is intended to teach parsing CLI output and returning stable numeric results.
