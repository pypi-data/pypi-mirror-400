# NeuroBase

NeuroBase is a lightweight educational machine-learning library written in pure Python and NumPy.
It provides clear implementations of classic algorithms plus a small metrics and optimizer module.

## Features

- `SimpleLinearRegression`, `MultipleLinearRegression`
- `LogisticRegression`
- `RidgeRegression`, `LassoRegression`
- `DecisionTreeRegressorCustom`
- `KNNClassifier`
- `KMeansNew`
- Gradient boosting (experimental)
- Metrics: MSE, MAE, RMSE, R², adjusted R²
- Optimizers: batch and stochastic gradient descent
- Fully tested with `pytest`

## Installation (local dev)

pip install neurobase
