  comment: "Number of bits per pixel in data"
NAXIS:
  description: "Mandatory keyword. Value depends on keyword position in file, i.e. whether the keyword is located in the primary HDU, or an extension HDU. Generally, the value field shall contain a non-negative integer no greater than 999 representing the number of axes in the associated data array. A value of zero signifies that no data follow the header in the HDU."

NAXIS<n>:
  description: "The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain a non-negative integer representing the number of elements along axis n of a data array. A value of zero for any of the NAXISn keywords signifies that no data follow the header in the HDU (however, the random groups structure has NAXIS1 = 0, but will have data following the header if the other NAXISn keywords are non-zero).

BSCALE:
  description: "This keyword represents the coefficient of the linear term in the scaling equation,
                the ratio of physical value to array value at zero offset. The default value for this
                keyword is 1.0. This keyword, along with BZERO, is used to linearly scale the array
