Tecton is the fastest way to build operational machine learning applications. It helps automate real-time decision making like fraud detection, product recommendations, and search result ranking in production applications.

Tecton is a fully-managed feature platform built to orchestrate the complete lifecycle of features, from transformation to online serving, with enterprise-grade SLAs.

With Tecton, you can:

- Define and manage features using code in a git repository.
- Automatically compute and orchestrate batch, streaming, and real-time feature
  transformations.
- Store and serve feature data for training and inference.
- Share, discover, and manage access to features.

# Contents of the `tecton-runtime` PyPI package

The `tecton-runtime` PyPI package bundles Tecton's Transformation Service Sidecar, which is used by Tecton's on demand feature view and stream ingestion capabilities.
It has the following configuration options available, that can be specified as environment variables:

- `TRANSFORM_SERVER_LOG_FILENAME`: The name of the log file to write to. Defaults to a temporary file.
- `TRANSFORM_SERVER_DISABLE_CONSOLE_LOGGING`: If set to `true`, disables logging to the console. Defaults to `false`.
- `TRANSFORM_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL`: The log level to use. Defaults to `DEBUG`.
- `TRANSFORM_SERVER_SOCKET`: The socket to listen on. Defaults to `/tmp/transform_server.sock`.
- `TRANSFORM_SERVER_ADDRESS`: The address to listen on. Defaults to `localhost:50051`.
- `TRANSFORM_SERVER_MAX_WORKERS`: The maximum number of workers to use by the grpc server. Defaults to `2`.
- `TRANSFORM_SERVER_HEALTH_STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: The interval in seconds to check the transform server stage and set the health servicer status. Defaults to `60`.

Only one `TRANSFORM_SERVER_SOCKET` or `TRANSFORM_SERVER_ADDRESS` should be set. If neither are set, the transform server will list on `[::]:50051`.
