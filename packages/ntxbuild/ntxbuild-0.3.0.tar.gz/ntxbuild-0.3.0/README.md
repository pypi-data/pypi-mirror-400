# ntxbuild

**NuttX Build System Assistant** - A Python tool for managing and building NuttX RTOS projects with ease.

ntxbuild is simply a wrapper around the many tools available in the NuttX repository. It wraps around tools
such as make, kconfig-tweak, menuconfig and most used bash scripts (such as configure.sh).

This tool provides a command line interface that supports NuttX configuration and building,
while also providing a Python API that allows you to script your builds.
