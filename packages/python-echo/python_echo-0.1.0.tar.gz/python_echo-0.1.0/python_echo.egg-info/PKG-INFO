## <ins> Echo </ins>

Echo is a lightweight and intuitive Python library for building and managing LLM-based chat conversations <br>
It provides structured tools for managing chat, including FIFO queue management, <br>
conversation topic evaluation, pertinence filtering, archiving, and more <br>

### <ins> Features </ins>

- Capacity: Limit the number of messages stored in the conversation (FIFO) <br>
- Topic evaluation: Evaluate the topic of the conversation and update it dynamically <br>
- Pertinence filtering: Filter out irrelevant messages based on the current topic <br>
- Archive messages: Archive the original message, keep a summarized version in the chat <br>

### <ins> Algorithms </ins>

<ins> Topic Evaluation </ins> <br>

- Init Message Topic (IMT) - The conversation topic is inferred solely from the content of the first message <br>
- Nth Message Topic (NMT) - The conversation topic is inferred from the content of the first N messages <br>
- Anchored Topic Evaluation (ATE) - The conversation topic is initially anchored using the first N messages <br>
  Afterward, the topic is dynamically re-evaluated with each new message, <br>
  allowing the model to adapt to topic shifts while maintaining stability around the original anchor <br>
  A new message may or may not affect the topic, <br>
  depending on whether it introduces a significant shift in content relative to the anchor <br>

import google.generativeai as genai
from synapse import Synapse

class GeminiClient(Synapse):
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"):
        genai.configure(api_key='<API Key>')
        self.model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name)

    def prompt(self, text: str) -> str:
        """ Sends a single string to the model and returns the text response """
        try:
            response = self.model.generate_content(text)
            return response.text
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An error occurred: {e}"
