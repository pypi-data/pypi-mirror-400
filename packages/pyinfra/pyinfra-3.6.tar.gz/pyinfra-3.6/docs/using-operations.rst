Using Operations
================

.. admonition:: What are operations?
    :class: tip

    Operations tell pyinfra what to do, for example the ``server.shell`` operation instructs pyinfra to execute a shell command. Most operations define state rather than actions - so instead of *start this service* you say *this service should be running* - pyinfra will make changes if needed.

For example, these two operations will ensure that user ``pyinfra`` exists with home directory ``/home/pyinfra``, and that the ``/var/log/pyinfra.log`` file exists and is owned by that user:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra.operations import server, files

    server.user(
        name="Create pyinfra user",
        user="pyinfra",
        home="/home/pyinfra",
    )

    files.file(
        name="Create pyinfra log file",
        path="/var/log/pyinfra.log",
        user="pyinfra",
        group="pyinfra",
        mode="644",
    )


Uses :doc:`operations/files` and :doc:`operations/server`. You can see all available operations in the :doc:`operations`. If you save the file as ``deploy.py`` you can test it out using Docker:

.. code:: shell

    pyinfra @docker/ubuntu:20.04 deploy.py

Global Arguments
----------------

Global arguments are covered in detail here: :doc:`arguments`. There is a set of arguments available to all operations to control authentication (``_sudo``, etc) and operation execution (``_shell_executable``, etc):

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra.operations import apt

    apt.update(
        name="Update apt repositories",
        _sudo=True,
        _sudo_user="pyinfra",
    )

Retry Functionality
-------------------

Operations can be configured to retry automatically on failure using retry arguments:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra.operations import server

    # Retry a flaky command up to 3 times with default 5 second delay
    server.shell(
        name="Download file with retries",
        commands=["curl -o /tmp/file.tar.gz https://example.com/file.tar.gz"],
        _retries=3,
    )

    # Retry with custom delay between attempts
    server.shell(
        name="Check service status with retries",
        commands=["systemctl is-active myservice"],
        _retries=2,
        _retry_delay=10,  # 10 second delay between retries
    )

    # Use custom retry condition to control when to retry
    def retry_on_network_error(output_data):
        # Retry if stderr contains network-related errors
        for line in output_data["stderr_lines"]:
            if any(keyword in line.lower() for keyword in ["network", "timeout", "connection"]):
                return True
        return False

    server.shell(
        name="Network operation with conditional retry",
        commands=["wget https://example.com/large-file.zip"],
        _retries=5,
        _retry_until=retry_on_network_error,
    )


The ``host`` Object
-------------------

pyinfra provides a global ``host`` object that can be used to retrieve information and metadata about the current host target. At all times the ``host`` variable represents the current host context, so you can think about the deploy code executing on individual hosts at a time.

The ``host`` object has ``name`` and ``groups`` attributes which can be used to control operation flow:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import host

    if host.name == "control-plane-1":
        ...

    if "control-plane" in host.groups:
        ...

Host & Group Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding data to inventories is covered in detail here: :doc:`inventory-data`. Data can be accessed within operations using the ``host.data`` attribute:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import host
    from pyinfra.operations import server

    # Ensure the state of a user based on host/group data
    server.user(
        name="Setup the app user",
        user=host.data.app_user,
        home=host.data.app_dir,
    )


Host Facts
~~~~~~~~~~

Facts allow you to use information about the target host to control and configure operations. A good example is switching between ``apt`` & ``yum`` depending on the Linux distribution. You can get a fact like this:

.. code:: bash

    pyinfra inventory.py fact server.LinuxName

Facts are imported from ``pyinfra.facts.*`` and can be retrieved using the ``host.get_fact`` function. If you save this in a file called `nano.py`:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import host
    from pyinfra.facts.server import LinuxName
    from pyinfra.operations import yum, apt

    if host.get_fact(LinuxName) == "Fedora":
        yum.packages(
            name="Install nano via yum",
            packages=["nano"],
            _sudo=True
        )
    if host.get_fact(LinuxName) == "Ubuntu":
        apt.packages(
            name="Install nano via apt",
            packages=["nano"],
            update=True,
            _sudo=True
        )

.. code:: bash

    pyinfra inventory.py nano.py


See :doc:`facts` for a full list of available facts and arguments.

.. Important::
    Only use immutable facts in deploy code (installed OS, Arch, etc) unless you are absolutely sure they will not change. See: `using host facts <deploy-process.html#using-host-facts>`_.

Fact Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^

When facts fail due to an error the host will be marked as failed just as it would when an operation fails. This can be avoided by passing the ``_ignore_errors`` argument:

.. code:: python

    if host.get_fact(LinuxName, _ignore_errors=True):
        ...

The ``inventory`` Object
------------------------

Like ``host``, there is an ``inventory`` object that can be used to access the entire inventory of hosts. This is useful when you need facts or data from another host like the hostname of another server:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import inventory
    from pyinfra.facts.server import Hostname
    from pyinfra.operations import files

    # Get the other host, load the hostname fact
    db_host = inventory.get_host("postgres-main")
    db_hostname = db_host.get_fact(Hostname)

    files.template(
        name="Generate app config",
        src="templates/app-config.j2.yaml",
        dest="/opt/myapp/config.yaml",
        db_hostname=db_hostname,
    )


Change Detection
----------------

All operations return an operation meta object which provides information about the changes the operation *will* execute. This can be used to control other operations via the ``_if`` argument:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra.operations import server

    create_user = server.user(...)
    create_otheruser = server.user(...)

    server.shell(
        name="Bootstrap myuser",
        commands=["..."],
        # Only execute this operation if the first user create executed any changes
        _if=create_user.did_change,  # also: did_not_change, did_succeed, did_error
    )

    # A list can be provided to run an operation if **all** functions return true
    server.shell(
        commands=["echo 'Both myuser and otheruser changed'"],
        _if=[create_user.did_change, create_otheruser.did_change],
    )

    # You can also build your own lamba functions to achieve, e.g. an OR condition
    server.shell(
        commands=["echo 'myuser or otheruser changed'"],
        _if=lambda: create_user.did_change() or create_otheruser.did_change(),
    )

    # The functions `any_changed` and `all_changed` are provided for common use cases, e.g.
    from pyinfra.operations.util import any_changed, all_changed
    server.shell(commands=["..."], _if=any_changed(create_user, create_otheruser))
    server.shell(commands=["..."], _if=all_changed(create_user, create_otheruser))

Output & Callbacks
------------------

pyinfra doesn't immediately execute operations, meaning output is not available right away. It is possible to access this output at runtime by providing a callback function using the :ref:`operations:python.call` operation. Callback functions may also call other operations which will be immediately executed. Why/how this works `is described here <deploy-process.html#how-pyinfra-detects-changes-orders-operations>`_.

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import logger
    from pyinfra.operations import python, server

    result = server.shell(
        commands=["echo output"],
    )
    # result.stdout raises exception here, but works inside callback()

    def callback():
        logger.info(f"Got result: {result.stdout}")

    python.call(
        name="Execute callback function",
        function=callback,
    )


There is also the possibility to use pyinfra's logging functionality which may be appropriate in certain situations.

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import logger
    def ufw_usable(function code here)
    is_ufw_usable = ufw_usable()
    logger.info('Checking output of ufw_usable: {}'.format(is_ufw_usable))


Produces output similar to:

.. code::

    --> Preparing Operations...
        Loading: deploy_create_users.py
        Checking output of ufw_usable: None
        [multitest.example.com] Ready: deploy_create_users.py


Include Files
-------------

Including files can be used to break out operations across multiple files. Files can be included using ``local.include``.

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import local

    # Include & call all the operations in tasks/install_something.py
    local.include("tasks/install_something.py")

Additional data can be passed across files via the ``data`` param to parameterize tasks and is available in ``host.data``. For example `tasks/create_user.py` could look like:

.. code:: python

    from getpass import getpass

    from pyinfra import host
    from pyinfra.operations import server

    group = host.data.get("group")
    user = host.data.get("user")

    server.group(
        name=f"Ensure {group} is present",
        group=group,
    )
    server.user(
        name=f"Ensure {user} is present",
        user=user,
        group=group,
    )

And and be called by other deploy scripts or tasks:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import local

    for group, user in (("admin", "Bob"), ("admin", "Joe")):
        local.include("tasks/create_user.py", data={"group": group, "user": user})

See more in :doc:`examples: groups & roles <./examples/groups_roles>`.


The ``config`` Object
---------------------

Like ``host`` and ``inventory``, ``config`` can be used to set global defaults for operations. For example, to use sudo in all following operations:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import config

    config.SUDO = True

    # all operations below will use sudo by default (unless overridden by `_sudo=False`)

Enforcing Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The config object can be used to enforce a pyinfra version or Python package requirements. This can either be defined as a requirements text file path or simply a list of requirements. For example, if you create a `requirements.py` file with:

.. code:: python

    # Require a certain pyinfra version
    config.REQUIRE_PYINFRA_VERSION = "~=3.0"

    # Require certain packages
    config.REQUIRE_PACKAGES = "requirements.txt"  # path is relative to the current working directory
    config.REQUIRE_PACKAGES = [
        "pyinfra~=3.0",
    ]

And create a `requirements.txt` file with something like this:

.. code:: bash

    pyinfra

Then modify the `nano.py` above to include these lines:
.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import local
    local.include("requirements.py")
