# penaltyblog: Football Data & Modelling Made Easy

**penaltyblog** is a production-ready Python package designed for football (soccer) analytics, providing powerful tools from [pena.lt/y/blog](https://pena.lt/y/blog) for data analysis, outcome modelling, and betting insights. Optimized with Cython, **penaltyblog** delivers high-performance modelling to power faster, efficient predictions.

## Features

- 🔄 **Streamline JSON Workflows with MatchFlow:** Process nested football data using a lazy, streaming pipeline built for JSON. Filter, select, flatten, join, group, and summarize large datasets without loading everything into memory.
- 🔌 **Connect to Professional APIs:** Seamlessly stream and filter data directly from industry leaders, like StatsBomb and Opta. Query matches, events, and stats using lazy loading without handling massive JSON dumps.
- 📊 **Model Matches Efficiently:** High-performance implementations of Poisson, Bivariate Poisson, Dixon-Coles, and other advanced statistical models, optimized with Cython for rapid analysis.
- 🧠 **Advanced Bayesian Modelling:** Full posterior distributions for match outcomes using MCMC sampling. Includes Hierarchical Bayesian models to automatically learn league-wide variances and handle parameter uncertainty.
- ⚽ **Scrape Data:** Collect match statistics from sources like Understat, Club Elo, and Fantasy Premier League.
- 💰 **Bet Smarter:** Precisely estimate probabilities for Asian handicaps, over/under totals, match outcomes, and more.
- 🏆 **Rank Teams:** Evaluate team strengths with sophisticated methods including Elo, Massey, Colley, and Pi ratings.
- 📈 **Decode Bookmaker Odds:** Accurately extract implied probabilities by removing bookmaker margins (overrounds).
- 🎯 **Fantasy Football Optimisation:** Mathematically optimize your fantasy football squad to maximize performance.
- 🎨 **Visualize with Style:** Create publication-ready pitch visualizations and data flow diagrams with customizable themes, supporting multiple data providers and flexible layouts.

Take your football analytics and betting strategy to the next level with **penaltyblog** 🚀

## Why Penaltyblog?

Unlike many football analytics resources that are academic, one-off, or hard to scale, `penaltyblog` is designed from the ground up to be **production-ready**, **performance-optimized**, and **practically useful**.

It combines advanced statistical models (including **Bayesian** and **Hierarchical Bayesian** variants), efficient implementations (via **Cython**), and real-world workflows, from scraping public data to modelling outcomes and optimising fantasy teams.

Built by [Martin Eastwood](https://pena.lt/y/about), who has worked with football clubs, governing bodies, player agencies and betting syndicates worldwide, `penaltyblog` is the foundation for football analytics.

Whether you're a club analyst, independent researcher, or just data-curious, `penaltyblog` gives you the tools to go from data to insight - fast, flexibly, and with confidence.

## Support & Collaboration

If you're working at a football club, agency, or organisation and want help applying these tools to your own data or workflows, I'm open to:

- 📂 Integration support
- 🔧 Custom model development
- 🧠 Technical collaboration on football analytics projects
