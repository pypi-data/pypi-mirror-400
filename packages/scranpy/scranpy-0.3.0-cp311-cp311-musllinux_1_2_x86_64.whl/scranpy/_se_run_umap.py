    Generate a UMAP visualization from an existing embedding.
    This calls :py:func:`~scranpy.run_umap` on a reduced dimension entry in a :py:class:`~singlecellexperiment.SingleCellExperiment.SingleCellExperiment`.

    Args:
        x:
            A :py:class:`~singlecellexperiment.SingleCellExperiment.SingleCellExperiment` object or one of its subclasses.
            Rows correspond to genomic features and columns correspond to cells.

        num_dim:
            Number of dimensions in the UMAP, passed to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_umap`. 

        min_dist:
            Minimum distance between cells in the UMAP, passed to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_umap`. 

        num_neighbors:
            Number of neighbors, passed to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_umap`.

        num_threads:
            Number of threads for the neighbor search and optimization, passed to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_umap`.

        more_umap_args:
            Additional arguments to pass to :py:func:`~scranpy.run_umap`.

        reddim_type: 
            Name or index of the existing reduced dimension embedding in ``x`` from which to generate UMAP coordinates.
            Alternatively a tuple, where the first element contains the name of an alternative experiment of ``x``,
            and the second element contains the name/index of an embedding in that alternative experiment.

        output_name:
            Name of the reduced dimension entry in which to store the UMAP coordinates in the output object.

    Returns:
        A copy of ``x`` with a new reduced dimension entry containing the UMAP coordinates. 

    Examples:
        >>> import scranpy
        >>> sce = scranpy.get_test_rna_data_se("pca")
        >>> # Using fewer iterations for a faster-running example.
        >>> sce = scranpy.run_umap_se(sce, more_umap_args={ "num_epochs": 50 })
        >>> sce.get_reduced_dimension("UMAP")[:5,:]
