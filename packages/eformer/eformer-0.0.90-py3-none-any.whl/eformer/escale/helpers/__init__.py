"""Helper utilities for automatic sharding rule generation and analysis.

This submodule provides classes and functions for defining, composing, and
analyzing sharding rules for JAX arrays. It includes rule-based sharding
strategies that can automatically determine optimal partition specifications
based on array shapes, memory constraints, and mesh configurations.

Classes:
    ShardingRule: Abstract base class for all sharding rules.
    AutoShardingRule: Automatically determines sharding based on array shapes.
    ShapeBasedShardingRule: Creates sharding based on array shape patterns.
    MemoryConstrainedShardingRule: Creates sharding to fit memory constraints.
    CompositeShardingRule: Combines multiple rules with priority ordering.
    ShardingAnalyzer: Validates and estimates memory usage for sharding strategies.

Functions:
    barrier_sync: Synchronizes all JAX processes at a barrier point.

Example:
    >>> from eformer.escale.helpers import AutoShardingRule, ShardingAnalyzer
    >>> # Create an auto sharding rule
    >>> rule = AutoShardingRule(mesh=mesh, axis_names=['dp', 'tp'])
    >>> # Apply the rule to a pytree
    >>> partition_specs = rule.apply(model_params)
    >>> # Analyze the sharding strategy
    >>> analyzer = ShardingAnalyzer(mesh=mesh)
    >>> issues = analyzer.validate_partition_specs(model_params, partition_specs)
