# CLI Reference

Lodestar provides a comprehensive CLI for managing multi-agent coordination.

## Progressive Discovery

The CLI is self-documenting. Run any command group without a subcommand to see available workflows:

```bash
lodestar agent    # Shows agent registration workflow
lodestar task     # Shows task management workflow
lodestar msg      # Shows messaging workflow
```

Each command also supports `--help` for detailed usage and `--explain` for context about what it does.

## Global Flags

All commands support these flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output in JSON format (for programmatic use) |
| `--explain` | Show detailed explanation of what command does |
| `--help` | Show help message |
