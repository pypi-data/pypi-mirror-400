# ChrisPyTools

ChrisPyTools is a set of tools and functions that can be used to quickly plot and analyze data. I started the project in 2019 as my personal “Python toolbox,” and it has been continuously refined and extended since then. I would love to share these functions with you to make your life easier!

See full documentation here: [ReadTheDocs](https://chrispytools.readthedocs.io)

To install `chrispytools`, use the following command:

```bash
pip install chrispytools
```
