## x-mlps-pytorch

Just a repository that will house MLPs for Pytorch, from garden variety to the exotic, so as to avoid having to reimplement them again and again for different projects (especially RL)

## Install

```bash
$ pip install x-mlps-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from x_mlps_pytorch import MLP

actor = MLP(10, 16, 5)

critic = MLP(10, 32, 16, 1)

state = torch.randn(10)

action_logits = actor(state) # (5,)

values = critic(state) # (1,)
```
