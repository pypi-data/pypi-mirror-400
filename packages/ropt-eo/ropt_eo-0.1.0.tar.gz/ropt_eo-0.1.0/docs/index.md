# An `everest-optimizers` plugin for `ropt`

The `ropt-eo` package extends the [`ropt`](https://tno-ropt.github.io/ropt/dev/)
module by providing a plugin that integrates optimization algorithms from the
`everest-optimizers` package. `ropt` itself is a robust optimization framework
designed for both continuous and discrete optimization workflows and is
extensible through its plugin architecture. Installing `ropt-eo` makes its
algorithms directly available within `ropt`.
