This module adds a Delivery Note report (納品書) to invoices. The report
displays the same content as the standard invoice but with a custom
title and no tax information.

Configurable report titles are available for invoices, credit notes,
delivery notes, and return slips.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module is designed for business flows where delivery notes are
created after validating the delivery and generating the invoice.

If you need to create delivery notes before validating the delivery
(during shipment preparation), this module will not meet your
requirements.

Configuration
=============

Go to *Invoicing → Configuration → Settings*:

- **Invoice Report (PDF) Titles**: Configure custom titles for
  invoice-related PDF reports. Standard titles are used if left blank.
- **Use Delivery Note Comment**: Enable the delivery note comment field
  on invoices and credit notes (enabled by default).
- **Hide Narration on Delivery Note**: Hide the standard invoice
  narration (terms and conditions) on delivery note and return slip PDFs
  (enabled by default).
