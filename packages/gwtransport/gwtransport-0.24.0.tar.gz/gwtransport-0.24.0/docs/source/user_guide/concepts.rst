Core Concepts
=============

Groundwater transport involves the movement of solutes and heat through porous media. This guide introduces the fundamental concepts underlying ``gwtransport``.

.. _concept-pore-volume-distribution:

The Central Concept: Pore Volume Distribution
---------------------------------------------

The central innovation of ``gwtransport`` is reducing complex 3D aquifer geometry to a **pore volume distribution**. This distribution captures the essential heterogeneity of an aquifer system.

Why This Matters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Heterogeneous aquifers have multiple flow paths with different travel times
- Water extracted from a well is a mixture from all these paths
- The pore volume distribution describes how much of the aquifer is "fast" vs "slow"
- A gamma distribution provides a flexible, physically meaningful approximation

**Key insight:** The pore volume distribution is constant over time (it's a property of the aquifer geometry), while flow rates and concentrations vary. Once calibrated, the same distribution can predict transport of any solute.

Key Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Mean pore volume**: Average volume of water in flow paths (m³)
- **Standard deviation**: Variability in pore volumes across different paths (m³)
- **Distribution shape**: Commonly approximated using a two-parameter gamma distribution

The gamma distribution model is implemented in :py:func:`gwtransport.advection.gamma_infiltration_to_extraction`. For cases with known streamline geometry, pore volumes can be computed directly using :py:func:`gwtransport.surfacearea.compute_average_heights` and passed to :py:func:`gwtransport.advection.infiltration_to_extraction`.

For assumptions about the gamma distribution, see :ref:`assumption-gamma-distribution`.

.. _concept-residence-time:

Residence Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Residence time is the duration a water parcel (or solute) spends in the aquifer between infiltration and extraction points. For a given streamline with pore volume :math:`V` and flow rate :math:`Q`:

.. math::

   t_r = \frac{V \cdot R}{Q}

where :math:`R` is the retardation factor. Residence time depends on:

- **Pore volume** of the flow path (m³)
- **Flow rate** through the system (m³/day)
- **Retardation factor** of the compound (dimensionless)

The distribution of residence times directly reflects the pore volume distribution. Use :py:func:`gwtransport.residence_time.residence_time` to compute residence times from flow rates and pore volumes. See the :doc:`/examples/02_Residence_Time_Analysis` example for practical applications.

.. _concept-retardation-factor:

Retardation Factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The retardation factor :math:`R` quantifies how much slower a compound moves compared to the bulk water flow. It accounts for interactions between the transported substance and the aquifer matrix:

- **Conservative tracers** (:math:`R = 1.0`): Move at the same velocity as water (e.g., chloride, bromide, salts)
- **Temperature** (:math:`R \approx 2.0`): Retarded by heat exchange with the solid matrix; exact value depends on porosity and heat capacity ratios
- **Sorbing solutes** (:math:`R > 1`): Delayed by adsorption to aquifer materials; magnitude depends on distribution coefficient :math:`K_d`

For temperature, the retardation factor can be estimated from aquifer properties (see :doc:`/examples/01_Aquifer_Characterization_Temperature`) or calibrated alongside pore volume parameters. For reactive solutes, :math:`R = 1 + \frac{\rho_b K_d}{\theta}` where :math:`\rho_b` is bulk density and :math:`\theta` is porosity.

For assumptions about retardation, see :ref:`assumption-linear-retardation` and :ref:`assumption-thermal-retardation`.

Temperature as a Natural Tracer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Temperature variations in infiltrated water serve as an effective natural tracer for aquifer characterization. Unlike artificial tracers, temperature:

- **Requires no injection**: Ambient seasonal variations provide the tracer signal
- **Enables continuous monitoring**: High-frequency temperature sensors are cost-effective
- **Has predictable behavior**: Retardation factor can be estimated from physical properties
- **Reflects transport processes**: Subject to the same advection and dispersion as solutes

The key limitation is that temperature undergoes diffusive heat exchange with the aquifer matrix, requiring a retardation factor correction. Once pore volumes are calibrated using temperature data, conservative solutes can be predicted using :math:`R = 1.0`. See :doc:`/examples/01_Aquifer_Characterization_Temperature` for a complete calibration workflow.

.. _concept-transport-physics:

Transport Physics
-----------------

.. _concept-transport-equation:

Core Transport Equation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The extracted concentration is a flow-weighted average over all flow paths:

.. math::

   C_{out}(t) = \sum_{i} w_i \cdot C_{in}(t - \tau_i)

Where:

- :math:`w_i` = weight of flow path i (from pore volume distribution)
- :math:`\tau_i` = residence time of flow path i
- :math:`C_{in}` = infiltrated concentration

This is mathematically equivalent to convolution, but implemented as discrete weighted averaging. The concentration at the extraction point is the flow-weighted average across all streamlines:

.. math::

   C_{out}(t) = \frac{\sum_i Q_i \cdot C_i(t)}{\sum_i Q_i}

where :math:`C_i(t)` is the concentration on streamline :math:`i` and :math:`Q_i` is the flow through that streamline. See :py:mod:`gwtransport.advection` for implementation details.

For assumptions about the transport framework, see :ref:`assumption-advection-dominated`, :ref:`assumption-steady-streamlines`, and :ref:`assumption-no-transverse-mixing`.

.. _concept-dispersion:

Dispersion Without Numerical Dispersion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A key advantage of ``gwtransport`` is how it handles dispersion:

**Macroscopic dispersion** arises naturally from the pore volume distribution:

- Fast flow paths deliver early arrivals
- Slow flow paths deliver late arrivals
- The mixture at the well shows a "dispersed" breakthrough curve

**No numerical dispersion** because:

- No spatial discretization (no grid cells)
- Analytical time integration
- Machine-precision mass balance

This is fundamentally different from traditional numerical transport models where dispersion must be parameterized separately and grid resolution affects results.

.. _concept-dispersion-scales:

Dispersion as Scale-Dependent Heterogeneity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All spreading in porous media transport arises from **velocity heterogeneity** at different scales:

1. **Molecular scale**: Brownian motion causes spreading even in uniform flow (:math:`D_m`)
2. **Pore scale** (~mm to cm): Velocity varies within and between pores (:math:`\alpha_L`, longitudinal dispersivity)
3. **Local scale** (~m to 10m): Conductivity varies between soil layers and lenses
4. **Aquifer scale** (~10m to km): Different streamlines have different path lengths (captured by APVD)

The boundaries between these scales are **not sharp**. This is why measured dispersivity (:math:`\alpha_L`) famously increases with experiment scale—larger measurements "see" more heterogeneity.

**gwtransport's approach:**

- The **pore volume distribution (APVD)** captures macro-scale heterogeneity explicitly
- The **diffusion module** adds molecular diffusion (:math:`D_m`) and mechanical dispersion (:math:`\alpha_L`)
- For most bank filtration applications, APVD dominates and pore-scale dispersion is negligible

**When calibrating APVD from breakthrough curves**, the fitted :math:`\sigma_{apv}` already includes all spreading sources at scales smaller than the APVD resolution. Adding :math:`\alpha_L` would double-count.

**When computing APVD from streamline analysis**, only macro-scale path lengths are captured. Pore-scale dispersion (:math:`\alpha_L`) can be meaningfully added.

See :doc:`/examples/05_Diffusion_Dispersion` for quantitative guidance on comparing these contributions and formulas to convert dispersion effects to equivalent APVD standard deviation.

Calibration Approaches
----------------------

Temperature Tracer Test (No Groundwater Model Needed)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Temperature variations in surface water propagate through the aquifer to extraction wells. By fitting modeled extraction temperature to observations, the gamma distribution parameters can be estimated.

**Advantages:**

- No artificial tracer injection required
- Uses naturally occurring temperature signals
- Continuous, low-cost monitoring with standard sensors
- Predictable thermal behavior (retardation factor ~2.0 for heat)

**Workflow:**

1. Measure T_in, T_out, Q over time
2. Optimize gamma(mean, std) to match observed extraction temperatures
3. Calibrated model ready for predictions

See :doc:`/examples/01_Aquifer_Characterization_Temperature` for a complete example.

Streamline Analysis (When Flow Model Exists)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When detailed flow field data are available (e.g., from numerical groundwater models), pore volumes can be computed directly without assuming a parametric distribution:

1. Compute streamlines from infiltration to extraction points using flow field data
2. Calculate cross-sectional areas between adjacent streamlines (:py:func:`gwtransport.surfacearea.compute_average_heights`)
3. Convert 2D streamline areas to 3D pore volumes: :math:`V_i = A_i \times d \times \theta`, where :math:`d` is aquifer depth and :math:`\theta` is porosity
4. Pass volumes directly to :py:func:`gwtransport.advection.infiltration_to_extraction`

This approach captures the actual distribution of flow paths, including multi-modal or irregular patterns that cannot be represented by a gamma distribution. The tradeoff is requiring detailed flow field information.

Model Approaches
----------------

.. _concept-gamma-distribution:

Gamma Distribution Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The gamma distribution provides a flexible two-parameter approximation for aquifer pore volume heterogeneity. The probability density function is:

.. math::

   f(V) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(k)\theta^k} V^{k-1} e^{-V/\theta}

where:

- :math:`k` is the shape parameter (dimensionless)
- :math:`\theta` is the scale parameter (m³)
- Mean pore volume: :math:`\mu = k \cdot \theta`
- Standard deviation: :math:`\sigma = \sqrt{k} \cdot \theta`

In practice, ``gwtransport`` parameterizes using mean and standard deviation directly (see :py:func:`gwtransport.gamma.bins`), which are more intuitive than shape and scale. The gamma model works well for moderately heterogeneous aquifers but may not capture multi-modal distributions or extreme heterogeneity.

For assumptions about the gamma distribution, see :ref:`assumption-gamma-distribution`.

.. _concept-nonlinear-sorption:

Non-Linear Sorption: Exact Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For contaminants with concentration-dependent retardation (Freundlich isotherm), ``gwtransport`` provides exact analytical solutions using front-tracking:

.. math::

   R(C) = 1 + \frac{\rho_b}{\theta n} k_f C^{(1/n)-1}

**Wave physics:**

- **Shocks** form when faster concentrations overtake slower ones
- **Rarefaction waves** form when concentrations spread apart
- For n > 1 (favorable sorption): Sharp rise, gradual decline
- For n < 1 (unfavorable sorption): Gradual rise, sharp decline

The solver tracks these waves analytically, eliminating numerical artifacts. Use :py:func:`gwtransport.advection.infiltration_to_extraction_front_tracking` for non-linear sorption.

See :doc:`/examples/10_Advection_with_non_linear_sorption` for a complete example.

Comparison to Complex Transport Models

   * - Uncertainty

     - Initial assessment, design screening
     - Detailed site characterization

**Key insight:** More complex models require more data to constrain additional parameters. If you don't have that data, added complexity doesn't improve predictions.

What gwtransport Does NOT Do
----------------------------

1. **Does not solve flow equations** - Requires flow rates as input
2. **Does not model 3D geometry explicitly** - Reduces to pore volume distribution
3. **Does not handle reactions** - Only retardation/sorption (see :ref:`assumption-no-reactions`)
4. **Does not model multi-species interactions** - Single compound at a time
5. **Does not include density-dependent flow** - Assumes fixed streamlines (see :ref:`assumption-steady-streamlines`)

These simplifications are intentional: they make the model tractable while capturing the essential physics for many practical problems.

For a complete discussion of all assumptions and when they apply, see :doc:`assumptions`.

Applications
