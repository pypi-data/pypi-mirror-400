"""
arifOS Integration Layer — v38 Memory Integration

This package provides integration between the v38 Memory Write Policy Engine
and the 000-999 pipeline stages.

Integration Modules:
- memory_sense: 111_SENSE ↔ Memory (context loading, recall)
- memory_judge: 888_JUDGE ↔ Memory (write policy enforcement)
- memory_scars: 777_FORGE ↔ Scar Detection (pattern recognition)
- memory_seal: 999_SEAL ↔ Ledger Finalization (audit trail)
- common_utils: Shared utilities to reduce duplication

Per: docs/arifOS-MEMORY-FORGING-DEEPRESEARCH.md (v38)

Author: arifOS Project
Version: v38.0
