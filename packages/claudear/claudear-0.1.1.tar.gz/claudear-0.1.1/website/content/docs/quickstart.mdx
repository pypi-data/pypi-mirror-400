# Quick Start

Get Claudear running in under 5 minutes with this quick setup guide.

## 1. Install Claudear

```bash
pip install claudear
```

## 2. Create Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
# Linear Integration
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
LINEAR_TEAM_ID=your-team-uuid

# Linear Workflow States (customize to match your board)
LINEAR_STATE_TODO=Todo
LINEAR_STATE_IN_PROGRESS=In Progress
LINEAR_STATE_IN_REVIEW=In Review
LINEAR_STATE_DONE=Done

# Repository
REPO_PATH=/path/to/your/repo

# ngrok (for webhook tunneling)
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your-ngrok-token
```

## 3. Start Claudear

```bash
claudear
```

Claudear will:
1. Start the webhook server on port 8000
2. Create an ngrok tunnel
3. Register the webhook with Linear (first run only)
4. Begin listening for issue updates

## 4. Test It

1. Go to your Linear board
2. Move any issue from **Backlog** to **Todo**
3. Watch Claudear pick up the task!

You'll see output in your terminal as Claude Code:
- Creates a worktree for the issue
- Analyzes the requirements
- Implements the solution
- Creates a PR
