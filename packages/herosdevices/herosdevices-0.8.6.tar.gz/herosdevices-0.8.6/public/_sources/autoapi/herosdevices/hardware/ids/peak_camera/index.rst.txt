   Bases: :py:obj:`herosdevices.core.templates.camera.CameraTemplate`


   A class to interface with IDS Peak cameras.

   The class provides functionality to control and capture images from IDS Peak cameras.
   It manages camera configuration, acquisition, and data streaming.

   .. important::

      To access the camera as non-root user, you need to add the following udev rule
      to :code:`/etc/udev/rules.d/99-ids.rules`::
      
          ATTRS{idVendor}=="1409", MODE="666"
      
      The vendor library must be obtained from the
      `official website <https://en.ids-imaging.com/download-peak.html>`_.
      Download the `IDS peak archive file`, unpack it at move the content of ``lib/ids/cti/`` to a place where
      the user running the driver can access it. This path then needs to be specified via the ``lib_path`` argument
      (``/opt/idspeak/ids/cti/`` in the example below).
      If you install the full ids peak software via the installer, ``lib_path`` is ``/usr/lib/ids/cti/``.
      
      To find the ``cam_id`` of your camera, you can use the script ``./bin/ids_open_camera_cpp_by_serno``.
      Executing it will list give a list of all connected cameras::
      
          IDS peak genericAPI "open_camera_by_serno" Sample v1.1.2

      In this example, the ``cam_id`` are ``1409f4e7c3b1`` and ``1409f4e7c3b3``.

   .. note::

      The :code:`node_map` attribute provides access to the camera node map. If you need to set some special
      nodes you can use that.
      You can find the available nodes in the official API manuals:

      :value: False



   .. py:method:: get_config_nodes(only_implemented: bool = True) -> dict

      Get all nodes from the camera in form of a dict including information about if they can be set/read.

      :param only_implemented: Shows only nodes that are implemented on the attached camera. If False, returns
                               all nodes the driver library knows



   .. py:attribute:: get_camera


   .. py:attribute:: acquisition_running
      :type:  bool
      :value: False



   .. py:attribute:: payload_metadata
      :type:  dict


   .. py:attribute:: keep_device_open
      :value: True



   .. py:attribute:: default_config
      :type:  str


   .. py:method:: get_device() -> collections.abc.Iterator[None]

      Yield a device handle.

      .. code-block:: python

          # use the device in a with statement
          with self.get_device() as camera:
              camera.do_something()



   .. py:method:: open() -> Any

      Open the device handler and assign it to `self._device`.



   .. py:method:: teardown() -> None

      Release the device handler and potentially de-initialize the API.



   .. py:method:: start() -> bool

      Fire a software trigger.

      :returns: True if successful



   .. py:method:: stop() -> bool

      Abort the exposure and release queued buffers.

      :returns: True if successful



   .. py:method:: reset() -> None

      Reset the device by aborting any ongoing exposure, closing and re-opening the handler.



   .. py:method:: get_status() -> dict

      Get a dict with the current device status.

      :returns: A dict with the device status



   .. py:property:: config_dict
      :type: dict


      Get a copy of the configuration dict.

      :returns: Copy of the configuration dict


   .. py:method:: update_configuration(new_config_dict: dict, merge: bool = True) -> None

      Update the configuration dict with new configuration.

      Each dict key corresponds a (new) configuration name.
      Each value is a dict with config property -> config value.

      :param new_config_dict: A dict of configurations where the keys are the configuration names
      :param merge: If ``True``, the new dict is recursively merged with the current set config dict. If ``False`` the
                    old configurations with the provided names (keys) are overwritten.



   .. py:method:: get_configuration() -> dict

      Get the currently active configuration.

      :returns: The currently active configuration.



   .. py:method:: configure(config: str = '', metadata: dict | None = None) -> bool

      Configure the device with the known configuration `config`.

      To add a configuration to the device, use :meth:`update_configuration`.

      :param config: Key (name) of the configuration
      :param metadata: Metadata that is merged into the current payload metadata dict which is send with every emitted
                       :code:`acquisition_data` event.



   .. py:attribute:: set_configuration


   .. py:method:: update_payload_metadata(metadata: dict, merge: bool = True) -> None

      Update metadata dict send with every emitted frame by the :code:`acquisition_data` event method.

      :param metadata: Metadata that is merged into the current payload metadata dict which is send with every emitted
                       :code:`acquisition_data` event.
      :param merge: If ``True``, the new dict is merged with the current set metadata dict. If ``False`` the old
                    metadata is overwritten by the given dict.



   .. py:method:: arm(metadata: dict | None = None, kill_running: bool = False) -> bool

      Arm the device with the currently active configuration.

      :param metadata: Metadata that is merged into the current payload metadata dict which is send with every emitted
                       :code:`acquisition_data` event.
      :param kill_running: If ``True`` any running acquisition will be stopped. If ``False`` and an acquisition is
      :param already running:
      :param an error will be raised.:

      :returns: True if arming was successful else False



   .. py:method:: acquisition_data(frame: numpy.ndarray, metadata: dict | None = None) -> tuple

      Event to emit new frames.

      .. note::
          The dtype of the frame is not changed here.

      :param frame: The frame payload data (for example an image or an scope trace)
      :param metadata: The metadata which is passed along the payload. This argument takes precedence over the
                       :code:`payload_metadata` attribute (for example set by the :code:`update_payload_metadata` method)
                       while merging the two dicts.

      :returns: A tuple of image and metadata(-dict)



   .. py:method:: acquisition_started(metadata: dict | None = None) -> dict

      Event emitted when the acquisition thread starts.

      :returns: A dict with acquisition metadata



   .. py:method:: acquisition_stopped(metadata: dict | None = None) -> dict

      Event emitted when the acquisition thread stops.

      :returns: A dict with acquisition metadata
