# PennGrader
Welcome to the PennGrader!

Here at PennGrader, we believe that learning comes from lots of practice...and from making lots of mistakes. 

After many years as a student I found myself very frustrated in the following homework timeline: struggle on a homework assignment for weeks, submit something that may or may not be right and then wait a few more weeks to receive any type of feedback, at which point I had forgotten all about the homework. After many years as a TA, I also found myself very frustrated with the common auto-grading tools, the hours and hours of manual grading and the onslaught of re-grade requests that came thereafter.

From these frustrations, the PennGrader was born!

The PennGrader was built to allow students to get instant feedback and many opportunities for re-submission. After all, programming is about making mistakes and learning from feedback! Moreover, we wanted to allow TAs and Instructors to write their homework in any way they pleased, without having to worry about the structure of a specific auto-grader. The examples below are done using Jupyter Notebooks which is the most common use case, but you can use this for normal Python homework as well.
