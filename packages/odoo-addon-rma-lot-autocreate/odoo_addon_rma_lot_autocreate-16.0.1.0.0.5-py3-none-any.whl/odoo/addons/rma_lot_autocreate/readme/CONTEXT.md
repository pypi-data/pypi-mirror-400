In some RMA processes, especially in repair and refurbishment businesses, 
returned products may come from outside suppliers or unknown sources.  
While these products didn't originate from your inventory, you may still need to:
- Assign a unique lot/serial number upon receipt
- Track the product through repairs, testing, and resale
- Print and attach labels for internal traceability

This module automates lot/serial assignment at RMA confirmation for tracked
products, ensuring every returned item is properly identified before it
enters your warehouse workflow.
