# Ratio ESL

Ratio support for the Elephant Specification Language (ESL) in Python.

## Quickstart

### Installation

RaESL can be installed using `pip install raesl[all]` for any Python version >=3.11.
For managed projects you can use:

- uv: `uv add raesl[all]`
- Poetry: `poetry add raesl -E all`

For RaESL's different subcommands and functionality, the wheel provides extras which you could
provide instead of the `all` used above:

- `doc`: documentation generation using pandoc, Markdown and optionally LaTeX.
- `jupyter`: a Jupyter ESL kernel.
- `pygments`: an ESL syntax highlighter for pygments.
- `rich`: Rich doc output in the form of Plotly images.
- `server`: A language server to parse documents.

The default `raesl compile` command is always available.

Please refer to the [usage documentation](https://raesl.ratio-case.nl) for more info on how to use
RaESL.

## Development installation

This project is packaged using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the environment manager and build
frontend. Packaging information as well as dependencies are stored in
[pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml).

For ease of use, this project uses the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner to
simplify common tasks. Installing the project and its development dependencies can be done by
running `just install` in the cloned repository directory or manually by running `uv sync --all-extras`.

Please consult the [justfile](./justfile) for the underlying commands or run `just` to display a
list of all available commands.

### Tests

Tests can be run using `just test` and subsequent arguments will be passed to pytest.

### Linting

Linting the project can be done using `just lint`, automatic fixes can be applied using `just fix`.
Linting config is included in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) for Ruff.

### Documentation

Documentation can be built using `just docs` or served continuously using `just serve-docs` with
the help of [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
