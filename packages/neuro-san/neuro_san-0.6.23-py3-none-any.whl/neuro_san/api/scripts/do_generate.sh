# Requirements:
#   We need to be able to export .proto files from here so they can be
#   protoc-compiled into external projects.
#   We also need to be able to run code in here that references pre-built
#   *_pb2*.py as a standalone library.
#
# Constraints:
#   When exported .proto files from here are used in external projects,
#   protoc-generated python there creates *another* local set of *_pb2*.py files
#   with a serialized version of a *copy* of the original .proto file in
#   its call to _descriptor_pool.Default().AddSerializedFile. When files
#   from both neuro-san and the external project are mixed, this sometimes
#   causes errors in the form of one of 2 errors:
#
#       1)  TypeError: Couldn't build proto file into descriptor pool:
#               Depends on file 'neuro_san/grpc/generated/agent.proto',
#               but it has not been loaded
#       2)  TypeError: Couldn't build proto file into descriptor pool:
#               duplicate symbol 'neuro_san.grpc.generated.agent.AgentStatus'
#
#   These errors arise due to unforgiving naming in the .proto here and unforgiving
#   placement constraints in the directory/package hierarchy.
#   When compiling the .proto file copy, it includes in the description sent to
#   AddSerializedFile() a file path that needs to be both relative to the
#   copied version of the .proto file and the external .proto file that is including
#   it for definitions.
#
#   Because of all this, we end up having to do a couple of things in this repo:
#       1)  .proto files need to live in the same place as where
#           the generated python files end up.
#       2)  Path/package/file names need to be specified from the top level of this repo.
#
#   In the end, any .proto file that is protoc-compiled here needs to come out
#   with the exact same contents of what is passed to AddSerializedFile()
#   when the external project's protoc operation copies and recompiles the .proto
#   file for its own purposes.  Though this isn't really documented anywhere AFAICT,
#   file placement and package naming is tweaked here so that kind of thing can happen
#   more easily in other external repos.
