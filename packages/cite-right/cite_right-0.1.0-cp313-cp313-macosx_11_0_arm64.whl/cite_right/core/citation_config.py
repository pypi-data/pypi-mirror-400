            `Citation.evidence_spans` when alignment indicates multiple disjoint match
            regions. The legacy `Citation.char_start/char_end/evidence` fields remain
            a single contiguous (enclosing) span for backward compatibility.
        multi_span_merge_gap_chars: Merge neighboring evidence spans when the gap
            between them is <= this many characters in the source document.
        multi_span_max_spans: Maximum number of evidence spans to return per
            citation after merging. If exceeded, the citation falls back to a single
            contiguous evidence span.
