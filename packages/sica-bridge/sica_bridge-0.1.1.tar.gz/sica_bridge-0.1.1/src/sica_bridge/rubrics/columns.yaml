# Note: The following rubrics are only proposed suggestions. The final version should be confirmed by the Engineer.

id: columns
version: 1
scope:
  component: "Columns"
  intent: "Post-earthquake column/pier damage screening from photos (multi-span bridge supports)"

r_states:
  R1:
    label: "Open"
    cues:
      - "Column appears plumb with no visible leaning or displacement."
      - "No visible cracking beyond insignificant hairline surface cracks."
      - "No concrete spalling/crushing and no exposed reinforcement or steel shell/jacket distress."
      - "No obvious deck/rail/abutment misalignment above the pier/column in the photo."

  R2:
    label: "Open but inspection needed"
    cues:
      - "Minor cracking or small localized spalls/chips in the column cover with no clear diagonal cracking."
      - "Localized cover damage at the top of the column near the cap/soffit."
      - "Minor surface distress (scaling, small delamination) without exposed rebar or core damage."

  R3:
    label: "Close but inspection needed"
    cues:
      - "Large diagonal (shear) cracks approximately 1/8 inch (≈3 mm) wide or greater, or multiple diagonal cracks suggesting shear distress."
      - "Spalled/crushed concrete in the column (base or along height), especially if reinforcing steel is exposed."
      - "Exposed rebar with signs of deformation, or broken/damaged concrete visible inside the reinforcement cage (loss of confinement)."

  R4:
    label: "Close immediately"
    cues:
      - "Catastrophic column failure or near-failure: severe crushing/spalling with major loss of section at the base or critical region."
      - "Core concrete badly fractured with extensive exposed reinforcement; bars/ties buckled, ruptured, or severely deformed."
      - "Column is severely tilted, laterally displaced, partially collapsed, or shows signs of imminent collapse."
      - "Any condition indicating the bridge may not remain stable."

decision_rules:
  - "Classify based on the inspection photo (first image). Reference images are for calibration only."
  - "Diagonal cracking and loss of confinement are treated as high-risk because aftershocks can rapidly worsen damage."

output:
  requirement: "Return only JSON. Keys: component_id, r_state, reason."
  reason_guidance:
    - "Reason must cite the visible cue(s) from the inspection photo (e.g., 'diagonal crack', 'base spalling with exposed rebar', 'column leaning')."
    - "Do not mention reference images explicitly; use them implicitly to interpret damage."
