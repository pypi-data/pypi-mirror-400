  "response_body": "To calibrate the thrusters, you'll need to follow a step-by-step process to ensure they're functioning optimally. First, power down the thruster systems and allow them to cool. Next, access the calibration panel and initiate the diagnostic sequence. The system will prompt you to adjust the thruster alignment and verify output levels. Once all parameters are within the recommended range, save the settings and restart the thrusters. This should complete the calibration. Let me know if you need more detailed instructions on any of these steps."
