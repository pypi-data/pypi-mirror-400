   Driver for a Santec SLM200 spatial light modulator.

   The images can be transferred to the SLM200 via USB or DVI. This driver, however, only supports
   communication via USB. Since image upload via USB takes roughly 150ms, this driver is limited to
   around 6Hz of refresh rate. Precise and externally synchronized timing is only possible in USB mode.

   In USB mode (also called memory mode) images can be pushed via USB and stored in one of 128 memory
   slots. The image slot displayed on the SLM can be set randomly by the driver or an advance from one
   slot to the next can be triggered by a software trigger, and internal timer, or a logic signal
   (Trigger IN SMB jack).

   The SLM contains an FPGA that the computer communicates with by writing to an output FIFO/pipe
   and reading from an input FIFO/pipe. These two FIFOs are transparently accessed through the FTDI
   driver (D3xx) which provides methods to read and write these FIFOs/pipes.

   This driver is reverse engineered by looking at the data the vendor software sends via USB.
   This was achieved by looking at the API calls to the functions FT_WritePipe and FT_ReadPipe
   in the D3XX.dll which handles the communication with the FTDI USB3.0 chip (FT601).

      Get the serial number of the santec firmware running on the SLM.

      This not the same as the serial number used to identify the FTDI chip.

      :returns: Serial number.



   .. py:method:: video_mode(mode: int | str = 'USB') -> bool

      Set the video source the SLM draws the images from.

   .. py:method:: trigger_output(on: bool | None = None) -> bool

      Activate the trigger output of the SLM.

      This is especially useful in DVI mode orwhen software/automatic triggers are used.

      :param on: Determines whether the trigger output should be activated
                 If not set the current status is returned

      :returns: Status of the operation.



   .. py:method:: do_phase_calibration(wavelength: int, max_phase: int = 2) -> bool

      Calibrate the change of the lights phase as function of the bit value of each pixel.

      This can be used to adapt for different wavelength of the light and to change the
      maximum phase change for the maximum pixel value of 1023 (10bit).

      .. attention::
          This command takes some minutes to finish!

      :param wavelength: Wavelength of the indicent light in nm
      :param max_phase: Maximum phase change in units of pi

      :returns: Status of the operation.



   .. py:method:: trigger_software_fire() -> bool

   .. py:method:: trigger(mode: str | None = None) -> str

      Set or query the trigger mode.

      .. hint::
          The SLM can be triggered from four different sources:
              * none     : The image selected by :func:`display_slot` is displayed continuously                              and no trigger changes this.
              * manual   : The image in the next slot is displayed when the software trigger                              :func:`trigger_software_fire` is called.
              * auto     : The change to the next image is periodically triggered by an internal timer.
              * external : The change to the next image happens when a logic pulse on the trigger in                              SMB-connector is received.

      :param mode: Name of the trigger mode to set. If no argument is given,
