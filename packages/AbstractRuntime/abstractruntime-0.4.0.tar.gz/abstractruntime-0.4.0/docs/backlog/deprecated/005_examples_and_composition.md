## Goal
Provide concrete examples demonstrating:
- workflow-as-node composition
- ask_user interrupt
- wait_until
- wait_job (placeholder interface)

## Deliverables
- `examples/` directory in abstractruntime (or docs-based examples)
- one example that pauses and resumes after user input
- one example that composes sub-workflows

## Acceptance criteria
