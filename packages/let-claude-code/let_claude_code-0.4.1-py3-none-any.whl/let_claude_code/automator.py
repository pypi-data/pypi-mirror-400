## Priority Order

1. **Security** - Fix any security vulnerabilities first
2. **Bugs** - Fix any bugs that affect functionality
3. **Tests** - Add tests to prevent regressions
4. **Code Quality** - Improve maintainability
5. **Performance** - Optimize where it matters
6. **Documentation** - Help future developers
7. **UX** - Improve the user experience
8. **Cleanup** - Remove cruft and modernize

## Your Task

1. **Analyze the current state**: Review the codebase to understand what has already been implemented and what's needed to achieve the goal.

2. **Identify the next steps**: Determine the most impactful improvements you can make RIGHT NOW to move closer to the goal. Focus on:
   - Features or changes needed to achieve the goal
   - Quality improvements that align with the goal
   - Technical debt that blocks progress
   - Missing functionality

3. **Make concrete progress**: Implement changes that move the project forward. This could include:
   - Adding new features
   - Improving existing code
   - Fixing issues
   - Refactoring to enable the goal

4. **Commit your changes**: For each improvement, commit with a descriptive message:
   - "feat: [description]" for new features
   - "fix: [description]" for fixes
   - "refactor: [description]" for refactoring
   - "docs: [description]" for documentation

## Guidelines

- **Be incremental**: Make meaningful but atomic changes. Don't try to do everything at once.
- **Prioritize impact**: Focus on changes that provide the most value towards the goal.
- **Stay aligned**: Every change should clearly connect to the goal.
- **Don't break things**: Ensure existing functionality continues to work.

## Limits

- Focus on at most 3-5 related improvements per run
