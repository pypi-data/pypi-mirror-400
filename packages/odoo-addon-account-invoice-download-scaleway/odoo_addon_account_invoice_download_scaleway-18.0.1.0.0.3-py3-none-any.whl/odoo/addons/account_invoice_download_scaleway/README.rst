This module adds a **Scaleway** backend to the
**account_invoice_download** module. It allows you to auto-download
`Scaleway <https://www.scaleway.com/>`__ invoices via the `Scaleway
Billing API <https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/billing/>`__.

Configuration
=============

First, you need to create an API Key. For that, login to your Scaleway
account. On the top right, click on your organization and then click on
*API Keys*.

Go to the *Applications* tab, create a new application called *odoo*
(for example). Once created, on the new *odoo* application, click on the
three horizontal dots and select *Overview*: add the application to the
group *Billing Administrators*.

Then, go to the *API keys* tab, and create a new API key linked to the
application *odoo*. Write down the secret key in a safe place. Your
Scaleway API key is now ready!

In Odoo, go to the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Import Vendor Bills
> Download Bills* and create a new entry. Select *Scaleway* as *Backend*
and set the Scaleway Secret Key.

Usage
=====

Refer to the usage instructions of the module
**account_invoice_download**.
