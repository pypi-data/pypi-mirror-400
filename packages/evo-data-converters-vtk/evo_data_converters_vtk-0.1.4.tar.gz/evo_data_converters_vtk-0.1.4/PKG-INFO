## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are available for the community to use and extend. 

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Pre-requisites

* Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12

## Installation

```shell
pip install evo-data-converters-vtk
```

## VTK

The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is open source software for manipulating and displaying scientific data

Refer here for more information: https://vtk.org/

To work with VTK files [the `vtk` Python package](https://pypi.org/project/vtk/) is used, which is a Python wrapper around the underlying `vtk` C++ library.

The VTK converter currently supports importing the following objects into geoscience objects:
- `vtkImageData`/`vtkUniformGrid`/`vtkStructuredPoints`
  - Imported as a `regular-3d-grid` object if there are no blank cells
  - Otherwise, imported as a `regular-masked-3d-grid` object
- `vtkRectilinearGrid`
  - Imported as a `tensor-3d-grid` object
- `vtkUnstructuredGrid`
  - Imported as an `unstructured-tet-grid` object if all cells are tetrahedrons
  - Imported as an `unstructured-hex-grid` object if all cells are hexahedrons
  - Otherwise, imported as an `unstructured-grid` object
