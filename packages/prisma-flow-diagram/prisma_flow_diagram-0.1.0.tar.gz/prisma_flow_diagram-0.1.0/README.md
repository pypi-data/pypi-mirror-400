# A Python Package for PRISMA Flow Diagrams

</div>

This packages creates PRISMA 2020--style flow diagrams using matplotlib.
You provide counts for each step of your screening process, and it generates a PRISMA 2020 flow diagrams.
The design goal is a **small, transparent interface** with sensible defaults and layout that adapts to your data.

It supports:

- **New reviews** (standard PRISMA 2020 flow chrat)
- **Updated reviews** (previous + new studies)
- **Other search methods** (optional extension)

You can either:

- pass structured counts programmatically, or
- derive counts automatically from a CoLRev `records.bib` file.

Upon generating the flow diagram, the input is validated and warnings are printed when the review is incomplete or when values are inconsistent.

> **Validation that prevents common errors.**
>
> PRISMA-Py checks your counts for internal consistency *before* drawing the diagram.
> Example checks:
>
> - screened ≤ identified − removed_before_screening
> - excluded ≤ screened
> - sought = assessed + not_retrieved
>
> By default you will get readable warnings; you can also configure validation to raise errors in CI.

Output formats: PNG (other formats coming soon).

## Installation

```bash
pip install py-prisma
```

## Public API

```python
from prisma_flow_diagram import plot_prisma2020_new, plot_prisma2020_updated

def plot_prisma2020_new(
    *,
    db_registers: Mapping[str, Any],
    included: Mapping[str, Any],
    other_methods: Mapping[str, Any] | None = None,
    # output
    filename: str | None = None,
    show: bool = False,
    figsize: tuple[float, float] = (14, 10),
    style: PrismaStyle | None = None,
) -> None:


def plot_prisma2020_updated(
    *,
    previous: Mapping[str, Any],
    new_db_registers: Mapping[str, Any],
    new_included: Mapping[str, Any],
    other_methods: Mapping[str, Any] | None = None,
    # output
    filename: str | None = None,
    show: bool = False,
    figsize: tuple[float, float] = (14, 10),
    style: PrismaStyle | None = None,
) -> None:
```

Note:

- `db_registers.identification.databases` can be a total or detailed breakdown (dictionary).
- `db_registers.identification.registers` is optional.

## Working with CoLRev Records

```python
from prisma_flow_diagram import plot_prisma_from_records

plot_prisma_from_records(filename="prisma_from_records.png")
```

As part of the CoLRev workflow:

```json
{
    {
    "data": {
        "data_package_endpoints": [
            {
                "endpoint": "prisma-flow-diagram"
            }
        ]
        }
    }
}
```

TODO: document how updated reviews and other search methods are added in the CoLRev workflow.

## Validation

The package validates PRISMA 2020 flow data before (and during) plotting
to catch inconsistencies.

Validation is designed to be:

-   **Non-blocking by default**: validation can be turned off, emit
    warnings, or raise errors
-   **User-friendly**: issues are reported with clear explanations and
    suggested fixes

**Example validation message**

> **WARNING**: Included exceeds assessed  
> In the databases/registers lane, more reports are included than were assessed for eligibility.  
> *Fix*: Reduce included reports or increase reports.assessed if assessed is incomplete.  
> *Rule*: included.reports ≤ db_registers.reports.assessed

### What is checked

**Required structure**

-   Presence of required top-level blocks for **new** and **updated**
    reviews
-   Presence of the main databases/registers lane
-   Presence of included and previous blocks where required

**Count validity**

-   No negative counts anywhere
-   Included study/report counts are non-negative

**Identification and screening consistency**

-   Removed records do not exceed identified records
-   Screened records do not exceed available records
-   Excluded records do not exceed screened records

**Full-text assessment consistency**

-   Reports sought is present
-   Reports not retrieved do not exceed reports sought
-   Reports assessed do not exceed reports sought
-   Assessed + not retrieved matches sought

**Included plausibility**

-   Included reports do not exceed assessed reports

**Other-methods lane**

-   Structural validity of `other_methods` blocks
-   Plausibility of counts if records or reports are provided
