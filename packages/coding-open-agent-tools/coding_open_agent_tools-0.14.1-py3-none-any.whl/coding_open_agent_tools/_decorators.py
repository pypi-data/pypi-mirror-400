"""Centralized decorator imports with graceful fallbacks.

This module provides conditional imports for agent framework decorators.
When frameworks are not installed, no-op decorators are used as fallbacks,
allowing the package to work without any required framework dependencies.

Supported Frameworks:
- Strands: @strands_tool decorator
- LangGraph: No decorator needed (works with standard callables)
- Google ADK: No decorator needed (works with standard callables)

All agent tools use @strands_tool decorator for Strands framework compatibility.
