This library uses the absolute minimum of `draco` so `trimesh` can support the `KHR_ext_draco` extension in compressed GLTF files.

It currently roundtrips GLB's.


### Prompt

We'd like to make the MINIMAL support library for `trimesh` that parses the very specific `meshes` extension `KHR_draco_mesh_compression`.
- Read the [GLTF exension summary](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_draco_mesh_compression/README.md) carefully
- Use [`nanobind`](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind) to create the `dracox` support library for trimesh. Try to use as little as possible from the `draco` submodule (ideally not loading the whole GLTF!)
- Set up the `pyproject.toml` to build as easily as possible using [scikit-build-core](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core)
- once `pip install .` works for dracox, edit `trimesh/exchange/gltf.py` to minimally tie in to the `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` handler.
- run `python script.py` which loads `example.glb` containing a draco-compressed mesh, and verify we're loading something from the compressed extension.
