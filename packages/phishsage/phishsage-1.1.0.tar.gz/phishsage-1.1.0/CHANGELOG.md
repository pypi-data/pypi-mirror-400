## [1.1.0] – 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- Corrected flag assignment for non-success statuses in the `scan_with_virustotal` function.

### Changed
- Renamed `free_hosting_providers` to `abusable_platform_domains` in `config.toml` and `loader.py` for improved accuracy.
- Renamed the `uses_free_hosting` heuristic to `uses_abusable_platform` for clearer semantics.
- Renamed CLI subcommand `attachment` to `attachments` for naming consistency.
- Updated `free_email_domains` and `abusable_platform_domains` datasets.
