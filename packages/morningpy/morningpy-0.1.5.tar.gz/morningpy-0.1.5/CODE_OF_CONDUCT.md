# Code of Conduct – MorningPy

## Purpose

MorningPy is an open-source Python library designed to help users responsibly access and analyze data from publicly available Morningstar APIs. This Code of Conduct defines ethical, legal, and professional standards for using, contributing to, and distributing MorningPy.

Our goals are to:

- Promote responsible data usage
- Respect Morningstar's intellectual property and infrastructure
- Encourage transparent, lawful, and ethical practices
- Foster a welcoming and professional community

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- All users of the MorningPy library
- All contributors (code, documentation, issues, discussions)
- Any downstream project or application built using MorningPy

## Core Principles

### 1. Respect Public API Usage

MorningPy only targets publicly accessible endpoints. Users must:

- Avoid accessing private, paid, authenticated, or restricted endpoints
- Never attempt to bypass paywalls, authentication mechanisms, or access controls
- Respect robots.txt, rate limits, and fair-use expectations

MorningPy must not be used to:

- Scrape protected or premium Morningstar content
- Reverse-engineer proprietary systems
- Circumvent licensing or subscription requirements

### 2. Rate Limiting & Infrastructure Respect

Users are expected to:

- Apply reasonable request rates
- Implement delays, caching, and batching where appropriate
- Avoid high-frequency or abusive request patterns

Excessive or abusive usage that could:

- Degrade Morningstar services
- Cause IP bans
- Create legal or reputational risk is strictly discouraged.

### 3. Legal & Compliance Responsibility

Users are solely responsible for ensuring their usage of MorningPy complies with:

- Morningstar's Terms of Service
- Applicable copyright and database protection laws
- Local, national, and international regulations

The MorningPy maintainers:

- Provide tooling only
- Do not grant any license to Morningstar data
- Are not responsible for misuse by end users

### 4. Data Attribution & Transparency

When using data obtained via MorningPy:

- Clearly attribute Morningstar as the original data source
- Avoid redistributing raw data in violation of licensing terms
- Be transparent about data provenance in research, dashboards, or publications

### 5. Ethical Use

MorningPy should be used for:

- Research and education
- Personal investment analysis
- Academic and non-abusive commercial use

It must not be used for:

- Market manipulation
- Deceptive financial practices
- Generating misleading or fraudulent information

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributors must:

- Follow clean, readable, and maintainable coding standards
- Avoid adding features that enable abusive scraping or ToS violations
- Document endpoints, assumptions, and limitations clearly
- Respect intellectual property and licensing constraints

Pull requests that:

- Enable bypassing restrictions
- Increase scraping aggressiveness
- Obscure the origin of data

will be rejected.

## Community Standards

We are committed to a respectful and inclusive environment.

All participants must:

- Be professional and constructive
- Respect differing viewpoints and experience levels
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, or aggressive behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment or intimidation
- Disruptive or bad-faith participation
- Encouraging misuse of the library

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in:

- Warnings
- Removal of content or contributions
- Temporary or permanent bans from the project

Decisions are made at the discretion of the maintainers, in the interest of the project's sustainability and legal safety.
