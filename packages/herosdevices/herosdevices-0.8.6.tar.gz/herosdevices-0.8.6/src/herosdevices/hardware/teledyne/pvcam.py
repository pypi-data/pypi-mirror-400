class PvcamCamera(CameraTemplate):
    """
    A class to interface with Teledyne PVCam Cameras.

    The class provides functionality to control and capture images from cameras.
    It manages camera configuration, acquisition, and data streaming compatible with the atomiq camera template.

    Args:
        cam_id: Serial number of the cam. Can be obtained for example from the ids-peak GUI. Note, that the id
            is only the first part of the value shown in the GUI, the part including the device type is not
            unique and may not be added to :code:`cam_id`.
        lib_path: Path to vendor library.
        config_dict: Dict of configuration values like shown in the json example above.
        default_config: Default key in :code:`config_dict` to use.

    Note:
        The vendor library must be obtained from the
        `official website <https://www.teledynevisionsolutions.com/products/pvcam-sdk-amp-driver/>`_
        Make sure that after the installation either the environment variable :code:`PVCAM_SDK_PATH` is set to the
        correct path or pass it via the :code:`lib_path` argument.

    Note:
        Other than the special config keys listed below, the keys are property names of the pyvcam
        :code:`Camera` object. You can find the full list of available properties sometimes in the pyvcam documentation
        or by crawling `this file <https://github.com/Photometrics/PyVCAM/blob/master/src/pyvcam/camera.py>`_.

        **Special Config Keys:**

        - ``exposure_time``: exposure time in seconds. Automatically sets the nearest resolution (`exp_res` camera
          parameter). If you want to set the `exp_res` attribute manually, use the camera key `exp_time`
          (in the corresponding units) instead of `exposure_time`.
        - ``trigger_delay``: Is added to the trigger delay that can be obtained by :py:attr:`PvcamCamera.trigger_delay`
          and can be used for a cable and camera dependent delay.
        - ``frame_count``: number of frame buffers to set up, `-1` means infinite number of frames. Note, that this is
          currently not supported though. If you need it implemented via a circular buffer, please open an issue or get
          in contact with us.
        - ``post_processing``: A dict of post processing parameters (only if camera supports it), of the form
          :code:`{'feature_name': ['param_name', 'param_value']}`. See the documentation of the camera for details.
