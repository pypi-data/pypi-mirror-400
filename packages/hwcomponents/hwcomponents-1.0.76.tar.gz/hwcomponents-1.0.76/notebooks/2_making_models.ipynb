    "### Creating Custom Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Models can be created by subclassing the `ComponentModel` class. Models\n",
    "estimate the energy, area, and leakage power of a component. Each model requires the\n",
    "following:\n",
    "- `component_name`: The name of the component. This may also be a list of components if\n",
    "  multiple aliases are used.\n",
    "- `priority_0_to_100`: The percent accuracy of the model. This is used to\n",
    "  break ties if multiple models support a given query.\n",
    "- A call to `super().__init__(area, leak_power)`. This is used to initialize the\n",
    "  model and set the area and leakage power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models can also have actions. Actions are functions that return a tuple of\n",
    "`(energy, latency)` for a specific action. For the TernaryMAC model, we have an action called `mac` that\n",
    "returns the energy of a ternary MAC operation. The `@action` decorator\n",
    "makes this function visible as an action. The function should return `(energy_in_Joules, latency_in_seconds)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models can also be scaled to support a range of different parameters. For example,\n",
    "the TernaryMAC model can be scaled to support a range of different technology nodes.\n",
    "This is done by calling the `self.scale` function in the `__init__` method of the\n",
    "model. The `self.scale` function takes the following arguments:\n",
    "- `parameter_name`: The name of the parameter to scale.\n",
    "- `parameter_value`: The value of the parameter to scale.\n",
    "- `reference_value`: The reference value of the parameter.\n",
    "- `area_scaling_function`: The scaling function to use for area. Use `None` if no\n",
    "  scaling should be done.\n",
    "- `energy_scaling_function`: The scaling function to use for dynamic energy. Use `None` if no\n",
    "  scaling should be done.\n",
    "- `leak_scaling_function`: The scaling function to use for leakage power. Use `None` if\n",
    "  no scaling should be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different scaling functions are defined and available in `hwcomponents.scaling`."
