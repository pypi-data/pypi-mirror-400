class DynamicMotionMagicTorqueCurrentFOC:
    """
    Requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore;
    Requests Motion Magic® to target a final position using a motion profile.  This
    dynamic request allows runtime changes to Cruise Velocity, Acceleration, and
    (optional) Jerk.  Users can optionally provide a torque current feedforward.
    
    Motion Magic® produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting to honor
    the specified Cruise Velocity, Acceleration, and (optional) Jerk.  This control
    mode does not use the Expo_kV or Expo_kA configs.
    
    Target position can be changed on-the-fly and Motion Magic® will do its best to
    adjust the profile. This control mode is based on torque current, so relevant
    closed-loop gains will use Amperes for the numerator.
    
    :param position: Position to drive toward in rotations.
    :type position: rotation
    :param velocity: Cruise velocity for profiling.  The signage does not matter as
                     the device will use the absolute value for profile generation.
    :type velocity: rotations_per_second
    :param acceleration: Acceleration for profiling.  The signage does not matter as
                         the device will use the absolute value for profile
                         generation.
    :type acceleration: rotations_per_second_squared
    :param jerk: Jerk for profiling.  The signage does not matter as the device will
                 use the absolute value for profile generation.
                 
                 Jerk is optional; if this is set to zero, then Motion Magic® will
                 not apply a Jerk limit.
    :type jerk: rotations_per_second_cubed
    :param feed_forward: Feedforward to apply in torque current in Amperes. This is
                         added to the output of the onboard feedforward terms.
                         
                         User can use motor's kT to scale Newton-meter to Amperes.
    :type feed_forward: ampere
    :param slot: Select which gains are applied by selecting the slot.  Use the
                 configuration api to set the gain values for the selected slot
                 before enabling this feature. Slot must be within [0,2].
    :type slot: int
    :param override_coast_dur_neutral: Set to true to coast the rotor when output is
                                       zero (or within deadband).  Set to false to
                                       use the NeutralMode configuration setting
                                       (default). This flag exists to provide the
                                       fundamental behavior of this control when
                                       output is zero, which is to provide 0A (zero
                                       torque).
    :type override_coast_dur_neutral: bool
    :param limit_forward_motion: Set to true to force forward limiting.  This allows
                                 users to use other limit switch sensors connected
                                 to robot controller.  This also allows use of
                                 active sensors that require external power.
    :type limit_forward_motion: bool
    :param limit_reverse_motion: Set to true to force reverse limiting.  This allows
                                 users to use other limit switch sensors connected
                                 to robot controller.  This also allows use of
                                 active sensors that require external power.
    :type limit_reverse_motion: bool
    :param ignore_hardware_limits: Set to true to ignore hardware limit switches and
                                   the LimitForwardMotion and LimitReverseMotion
                                   parameters, instead allowing motion.
                                   
                                   This can be useful on mechanisms such as an
                                   intake/feeder, where a limit switch stops motion
                                   while intaking but should be ignored when feeding
                                   to a shooter.
                                   
                                   The hardware limit faults and
                                   Forward/ReverseLimit signals will still report
                                   the values of the limit switches regardless of
                                   this parameter.
    :type ignore_hardware_limits: bool
    :param ignore_software_limits: Set to true to ignore software limits, instead
                                   allowing motion.
                                   
                                   This can be useful when calibrating the zero
                                   point of a mechanism such as an elevator.
                                   
                                   The software limit faults will still report the
                                   values of the software limits regardless of this
                                   parameter.

    :param use_timesync: Set to true to delay applying this control request until a
                         timesync boundary (requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore). This
                         eliminates the impact of nondeterministic network delays in
                         exchange for a larger but deterministic control latency.
                         
                         This requires setting the ControlTimesyncFreqHz config in
                         MotorOutputConfigs. Additionally, when this is enabled, the
                         UpdateFreqHz of this request should be set to 0 Hz.
