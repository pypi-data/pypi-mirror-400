# ai-kissing

A Python library providing automated tools to explore and integrate with ai-kissing capabilities, designed to interact with the services offered by https://supermaker.ai/video/ai-kissing/. This package simplifies accessing and utilizing ai-driven kissing simulation and analysis.

## Installation

To install the `ai-kissing` package, use pip:
bash
pip install ai-kissing

## Basic Usage

Here are a few examples demonstrating how to use the `ai-kissing` library:

**1. Generating a Kissing Probability Score:**

This example demonstrates how to calculate a probability score based on provided facial images.
python
from ai_kissing import AIKissing

ai_kiss = AIKissing()

image1_path = "path/to/image1.jpg"
image2_path = "path/to/image2.jpg"

try:
    probability = ai_kiss.get_kissing_probability(image1_path, image2_path)
    print(f"Kissing Probability: {probability}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

**2. Simulating a Kissing Scenario (Text-Based):**

This example shows how to generate a text-based simulation of a kissing scenario.
python
from ai_kissing import AIKissing

ai_kiss = AIKissing()

try:
    scenario = ai_kiss.generate_kissing_scenario(description="A romantic sunset kiss on the beach.")
    print(f"Generated Scenario: {scenario}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

**3. Analyzing an Existing Video for Kissing Moments:**

This example outlines how to identify potential kissing moments within a video file.
python
from ai_kissing import AIKissing

ai_kiss = AIKissing()

video_path = "path/to/video.mp4"

try:
    kissing_moments = ai_kiss.analyze_video(video_path)
    print(f"Kissing Moments: {kissing_moments}") # Returns timestamps or frame numbers
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

**4.  Generating a Kissing Themed Poem:**

This example uses the AI to generate a poem related to kissing.
python
from ai_kissing import AIKissing

ai_kiss = AIKissing()

try:
    poem = ai_kiss.generate_kissing_poem(theme="first love")
    print(f"Kissing Poem: {poem}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

## Features

*   **Kissing Probability Assessment:**  Calculate the likelihood of a kissing scenario based on facial image analysis.
*   **Kissing Scenario Generation:** Create text-based kissing scenarios based on descriptive prompts.
*   **Video Analysis for Kissing Moments:** Identify and timestamp potential kissing moments within video footage.
*   **Kissing Themed Content Generation:** Generate poems and other content related to kissing.
*   **Easy Integration:** Simple API for seamless integration with other applications.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to provide informative messages in case of issues.
