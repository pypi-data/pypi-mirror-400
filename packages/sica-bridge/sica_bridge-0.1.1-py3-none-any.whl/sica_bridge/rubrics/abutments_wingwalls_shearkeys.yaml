# Note: The following rubrics are only proposed suggestions. The final version should be confirmed by the Engineer.

id: abutments
version: 1
scope:
  component: "Abutments"
  intent: "Post-earthquake abutment stability and unseating-risk screening from photos"

r_states:
  R1:
    label: "Open"
    cues:
      - "Abutment face may show spalls and/or large cracks, but the bridge span remains seated with no indication of unseating."
      - "No visible lateral offset between the superstructure and the abutment seat."
      
  R3:
    label: "Close but inspection needed"
    cues:
      - "Visible lateral offset of the superstructure relative to the abutment (bridge shifted sideways on the seat)."
      - "Any indication that remaining bearing length may be reduced/uncertain, creating a potential unseating hazard."

decision_rules:
  - "Classify based on the inspection photo (first image). Reference images are for calibration only."
  - "If any cue for a higher severity is clearly present, choose the higher severity."
  - "If unsure between two adjacent states, choose the more conservative (higher) state."
  - "For abutments, cracking/spalling alone is not sufficient for closure unless it is associated with displacement or unseating risk."

output:
  requirement: "Return only JSON. Keys: component_id, r_state, reason."
  reason_guidance:
    - "Reason must cite the visible cue(s) from the inspection photo (e.g., 'lateral offset at abutment seat', 'vertical drop at deck edge')."
    - "Do not mention reference images explicitly; use them implicitly to interpret damage."
