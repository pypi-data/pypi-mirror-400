# lolbin

A command-line interface tool for managing pastes on [paste.lol](http://paste.lol), a service of omg.lol.  
It does only that but it does it well.

**WARNING**: Remember that every past on paste.lol is **public**.
If you have the URL of the paste, you can fetch it without authentication.

You can access every listed paste of someone on the web at "https://paste.lol/<username>".
Mines are here: <https://paste.lol/ache>.


## Features

- **Create/Update Paste** - Allows you to create or update a paste with a specified title and content.
- **List Pastes** - Lists all your pastes along with their titles and the time they were last modified.
- **Show Paste** - Displays the content of a specific paste by its title.
- **Delete Paste** - Deletes a specific paste by its title.
- **Help Message** - Provides usage instructions for the tool.
- **Debug Mode** - Prints the action to be performed, the paste name, username, and bearer token (but does not actually perform the action).

## Very quick use

- **List Pastes** - `lolbin`
- **List public Pastes**- `lolbin -P`
- **Show Paste** - `lolbin paste-name`
- **Create paste** - `echo 'My paste' | lolbin paste-name` (will also replace a paste).
- **Create listed paste** - `echo 'My paste' | lolbin paste-name -L`
- **Edit paste** - `lolbin -e paste-nameP`
- **Delete Paste** - `lolbin -d paste-name`


# Installation

To install the tool, you can use pip:

```shell
$ pip install lolbin
```

But the recommanded way is via [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):
```shell
$ pipx install lolbin
```

Or with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):
```shell
$ uv run lolbin
```

On Arch Linux, there is a package on the AUR, so use your prefered AUR packages manager, mine is [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay):
```shell
$ yay -S lolbin
```


## Configuration

To configure the tool, create a file `~/.config/lolbin/config.toml` with the following content:

```toml
username = "your_username"
bearer_token = "your_bearer_token"
```

You can obtain a bearer token by logging in to the <omg.lol> website, in [you account](https://home.omg.lol/account), at the end of the page, section 'API Key'.

If you don't want to store you API token inside a config file, you can call external command to retrieve it from you secret manager.

With the backtick syntax for command substitution:

```toml
username = "your_username"
bearer_token = "`bws secret get XXXXXX` | jq .key --raw-output"
```

Or with the dollard based one:

```toml
username = "your_username"
bearer_token = "$ pass api.omg.lol/token_lolbin"
```


## Example of Use

1. To create/update a paste:
    ```shell
    $ echo "My awesome content" | lolbin --paste my_awesome_paste
    ```
    If you want to paste content from a file, use the `--file` flag:
    ```shell
    $ echo "My awesome content" > my_content.txt
    $ lolbin --paste --file my_content.txt my_awesome_paste
    ```

    The `--past` part is optional, as lolbin can deduct the action from the input.

    ```shell
    $ cat my_content.txt | lolbin --paste my_awesome_paste
    ```

    For obvious reasons, by default a past is private (aka non-listed, remember *every past is exposed on the public web*), to make it public (aka listed in the paste.lol jargon) use the "--public" (or "-P") option.
    ```shell
    $ echo "This is public !" | lolbin public-message -P
    ```

    I know that "-P" can be confused with "private", the idea is that, by default it's private so you don't need a private option.
    If you find it confusing, you can also use the paste.lol jargon with "--listed" (and "-L").


2. To list your pastes:
    ```shell
    $ lolbin --list
     - my_awesome_paste (10s ago)
    ```

    List is the default action so you can also ommit the `--list`.

    Also, by default, it only list all the paste, so the private one too (aka non-listed).
    To list only the public paste (aka listed in the paste.lol jargon), use the "--public" option (or "-P", or "--listed" and "-L").

    It's conveniant to remember that "-l" is for private and "-L" will list every paste.

    ```shell
    $ lolbin -l
     - my_awesome_listed_paste (30s ago)
     - my-awesome-private-paste (1min ago)
    $ lolbin -L
     - my_awesome_listed_paste (33s ago)
    ```

3. To show the content of a specific paste:
    ```shell
    $ lolbin --show my_awesome_paste
    My awesome content
    ```

    As with the `--paste` option, lolbin can deduct the action without the `--show` option.

    ```shell
    $ lolbin my_awesome_paste
    My awesome content
    ```

4. To delete a specific paste:
    ```shell
    $ lolbin --delete my_awesome_paste
    ```

    Or use the `-d` short option.

5. To edit a specific paste:
    ```shell
    $ lolbin --edit my_awesome_paste
    ```

    The editor will be opened with the content of the paste. The content will be replaced with the edited content.
    The editor is determined by the `EDITOR` environment variable. If it is not set, the vim is used.

6. For help:
    ```shell
    $ lolbin --help
    ```

7. To run in debug mode, use the `--debug` flag with any command:
    ```shell
    $ lolbin --debug --list
    ```

    It will not do anything.

   But too inconvenient to use for me for paste, ideal for status.
 - [Pastol](https://github.com/M1n-74316D65/Pastol): A CLI for paste.lol.
   Nice and in Rust ! 🦀. But again, it lakes some usefull features like retrieve the API token from a manager.
   But have some others nice features. (search ! And a nice UI to show a paste).

   Nice but incomplet.
