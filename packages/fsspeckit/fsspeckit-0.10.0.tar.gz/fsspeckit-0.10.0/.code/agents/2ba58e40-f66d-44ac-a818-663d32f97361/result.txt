I will start by listing the files in the `examples/datasets/getting_started/` directory and reading the relevant README files to understand the intended usage and requirements of the example scripts.
I will attempt to run the first example script, `01_duckdb_basics.py`, and check the `pyproject.toml` file to confirm the project's dependency definitions and identify any missing packages.
I will read the `pyproject.toml` file to examine the project's dependencies and understand the environment configuration.
I will examine the `01_duckdb_basics.py` script to check for potential API misuse or missing dependencies, keeping in mind that `pyarrow` is listed in both the core and optional `datasets` dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
I will now examine `03_simple_merges.py` and the other scripts to see if they also depend on `pyarrow` and if they are consistent with the `pyproject.toml` dependencies, while also checking for any potential issues in the virtual environment setup.
The scripts all require `pyarrow`, so the `ModuleNotFoundError` is expected if it's missing. I'll check the `uv.lock` file to see if `pyarrow` is listed, as the user mentioned they're using `uv`.
I'm searching for `pyarrow` in `uv.lock`.
`pyarrow` is in `uv.lock`, so it should be installed. The `ModuleNotFoundError` likely means the user isn't using the `uv`-managed Python interpreter. I'll check the root and `examples` `README.md` files for instructions on running the examples.
The `examples/README.md` suggests creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies from `requirements.txt` or via `pip install`. If the user is running the scripts without activating the `.venv` in the root, it might fail. I'll check `examples/requirements.txt` and then see if `uv run` works.
To fix the "Getting Started" examples, I'll ensure dependencies are installed, verify the environment, and check the scripts for issues like path errors or API changes. `01_duckdb_basics.py` seems okay with its use of `tempfile` and `DuckDBParquetHandler`, so I'll now examine `02_pyarrow_basics.py`.
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyarrow'` is the main issue. Since I can't run commands and the scripts depend on `pyarrow`, `duckdb`, `pandas`, and `polars`, I'll propose a fix plan. This involves running `uv sync` or `pip install -e .[datasets,sql]`, verifying dependencies, and using `uv run` for the examples. I'll also check `05_duckdb_upserts.py` for any additional missing dependencies.
I've reviewed the scripts and identified the main issues: missing dependencies, incorrect virtual environment usage, and some redundancy in `pyproject.toml`. I'll now create a todo list for the fix plan and then provide my final response.
The root cause of the `ModuleNotFoundError` is likely an unsynchronized environment. My fix plan involves using `uv sync` or `pip install`, running scripts with `uv run`, and verifying core dependencies. I've confirmed that `05_duckdb_upserts.py` and `DuckDBParquetHandler` are used correctly, but I'll now check `src/fsspeckit/datasets/__init__.py` to ensure all necessary functions are exported.
The exports are correct and match the examples. I'll now check `04_pyarrow_merges.py` to see if it uses any new APIs.
I've completed my investigation into the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyarrow'` issues with the "Getting Started" examples. The `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files confirm that `pyarrow` is a required dependency, and its absence suggests the examples are being run in an unsynchronized or incorrect Python environment.

### Root Cause Analysis
The `ModuleNotFoundError` occurs because the environment where the scripts are executed does not have the project's dependencies installed. Since the project uses `uv` (indicated by `uv.lock`), it's likely that a virtual environment exists but isn't being utilized correctly during script execution.

### Proposed Fix Plan

1. **Synchronize the Environment**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed in the project's virtual environment.
   - If using `uv`: Run `uv sync`.
   - If using `pip`: Run `pip install -e .[datasets,sql,common]`.

2. **Execute Examples via `uv run`**: To ensure scripts use the managed environment, execute them using the `uv run` command:
   ```bash
   uv run python examples/datasets/getting_started/01_duckdb_basics.py
   ```

3. **Verify Core Dependencies**: Manually verify the installation of essential packages used across the examples:
   - `pyarrow` (Core requirement for all examples)
   - `duckdb` (Required for `01_duckdb_basics.py` and `05_duckdb_upserts.py`)
   - `pandas` (Used for data display in several scripts)
   - `polars` (Optional but used in advanced examples)

4. **Follow the Sequential Learning Path**: Run the scripts in the recommended order to build foundational knowledge:
   - `01_duckdb_basics.py`
   - `02_pyarrow_basics.py`
   - `03_simple_merges.py`
   - `04_pyarrow_merges.py`
   - `05_duckdb_upserts.py`

5. **Optional: Use Example-Specific Requirements**: If running examples in isolation, use the dedicated requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
   ```

No code modifications are required in the scripts themselves, as they correctly implement the `fsspeckit` API and utilize standard `pyarrow`/`duckdb` patterns. The issue is purely environmental.
I've analyzed the `ModuleNotFoundError` and confirmed that `pyarrow` is a required dependency in both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. The issue is likely due to the scripts being run in an unsynchronized environment. My proposed fix plan includes synchronizing the environment with `uv sync` or `pip install`, and using `uv run` to ensure the correct environment is used when executing the examples.
