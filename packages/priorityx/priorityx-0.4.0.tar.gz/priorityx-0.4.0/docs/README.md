# Docs overview

This folder holds the main reference material for `priorityx`.

- `quickstart.md` – short walk‑through: install, load data, run a first
  priority matrix and plot it.
- `api-reference.md` – function‑by‑function notes for the core modules
  (GLMM, movement, transitions, plots, helpers).
- `methodology.md` – background on the modelling choices: Poisson GLMM,
  time aggregation, movement tracking, and how we think about risk
  quadrants.
- `priority_classification.md` – how P1–P4 priorities and spike markers
  are defined and used in timelines.
 - `output_naming.md` – how plot/CSV artifacts are named and where they
   are written on disk (e.g. `results/plot`, `results/csv`).
