.. py:class:: SerialDeviceTemplate(address: str, baudrate: int, write_line_termination: bytes = b'', read_line_termination: bytes = b'\n', keep_alive: bool = True, delays: dict | None = None, **kwargs)

   Template (base class) for devices which are controlled or read out through a serial interface.

   The interface must be accessible via pyserial. This can be via UART, Serial via IP, etc.

   Inheriting your device driver from this class allows to use `herosdevices.core.DeviceCommandQuantity` to define
   the serial commands within your device driver class.
