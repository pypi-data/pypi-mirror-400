"""
Deterministic signal extraction for sklearn-diagnose.

This module computes quantitative statistics from the evidence.
All computations are deterministic and reproducible.

Signal extractors are organized by category:
- Performance signals (train/val scores, gaps)
- CV signals (mean, std, fold analysis)
- Residual signals (for regression)
- Classification signals (class distribution, per-class metrics)
- Feature signals (correlations, redundancy)
- Leakage signals (suspicious patterns)
