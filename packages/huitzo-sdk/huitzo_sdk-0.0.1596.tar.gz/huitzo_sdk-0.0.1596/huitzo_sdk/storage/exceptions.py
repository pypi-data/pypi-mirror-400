class DocumentNotFoundError(StorageError):
    """
    Raised when attempting to access a document that doesn't exist.

    Example:
        ```python
        try:
            doc = await store.get("nonexistent_id")

    This occurs when:
    - Trying to access another plugin's data without grant_access()
    - Attempting cross-tenant access

    Example:
        ```python

    """
    Raised when document data is invalid or malformed.

    This occurs when:
    - Data is not JSON-serializable
    - Required fields are missing
    - Data violates schema constraints

    Example:
        ```python
        try:
            # Attempting to save non-serializable data
            await store.save("key", {"func": lambda x: x})

    """
    Raised when namespace configuration is invalid.

    This occurs when:
    - Tenant ID, user ID, or plugin ID are invalid
    - Namespace isolation is violated
    - Cross-namespace operation attempted

    Example:
        ```python
        try:
            namespace = Namespace(
                tenant_id="invalid",  # Should be UUID

    """
    Raised when storage quota limits are exceeded.

    This occurs when:
    - Document count exceeds quota
    - Storage size exceeds quota
    - Rate limits exceeded

    Example:
        ```python
        try:
            await store.save("key", large_data)

class ConnectionError(StorageError):
    """
    Raised when unable to connect to storage backend.
