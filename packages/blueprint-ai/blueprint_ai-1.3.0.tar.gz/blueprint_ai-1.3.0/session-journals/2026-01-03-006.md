# Blueprint Session 2026-01-03-006 — COMPLETE

## Session Focus: Public Release Readiness & Anti-Bypass Defense

### Executive Summary

**Blueprint v1.2.0 shipped.** Created comprehensive public release procedure, deployed anti-bypass defense system with generation metadata, and selected Apache 2.0 licensing. All code committed and ready for public repo creation.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Multi-Agent Analysis Attempt
- Dispatched 4 agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Aider) via Outpost
- Identified Outpost dispatch.sh URL prepending bug
- Completed manual security review as fallback

### 2. Security Audit Results
| Finding | Severity | Location | Remediation |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Hardcoded AWS credentials | CRITICAL | outpost.py:379-384 | Remove in release procedure |
| Hardcoded infrastructure IDs | HIGH | outpost.py:24-27 | Parameterize in release |
| No LICENSE file | HIGH | repo root | Create Apache 2.0 in release |
| Session journals | MEDIUM | session-journals/ | Exclude from public release |
| .zeos/ directory | MEDIUM | .zeos/ | Exclude from public release |

### 3. PUBLIC_RELEASE_PROCEDURE.md
Complete 8-step sanitization pipeline:
1. Create clean workspace (clone working repo)
2. Remove zeOS content (.zeos/, session-journals/)
3. Sanitize source (remove credentials, parameterize defaults)
4. Create release files (LICENSE, README, NOTICE)
5. Update pyproject.toml URLs
6. Create community files (CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY)
7. Clean git history (optional fresh init)
8. Push to public repository

**Key Design:** Working repo NEVER modified. All sanitization happens during copy.

### 4. Anti-Bypass Defense System

**Problem Solved:** Agents reading BLUEPRINT_INTERFACE.md were manually generating pseudo-Blueprints, bypassing the compiler and producing invalid output.

**3-Layer Solution:**

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| Documentation | CRITICAL warning section in BLUEPRINT_INTERFACE.md |
| Detection | Generation metadata embedded in all Blueprint output |
| Guidance | Clear instructions for network-restricted agents |

**Metadata Block (assembler.py):**
```html
<!-- BLUEPRINT METADATA (DO NOT REMOVE) -->
<!-- _blueprint_version: 1.2.0 -->
<!-- _generated_at: {UTC timestamp} -->
<!-- _generator: blueprint.generator.assembler -->
<!-- END METADATA -->
```

### 5. License Decision: Apache 2.0
| Factor | Why Apache 2.0 |
|--------|----------------|
| Patent protection | Explicit grant protects users and contributors |
| Contributor license | Built-in CLA equivalent |
| Enterprise adoption | Preferred by corporations over MIT |
| Derivative works | Changes must be documented |
| Compatibility | Works with all current dependencies |

## Deferred Items

- [ ] Create public repo (zeroechelon/blueprint or blueprint-ai/blueprint)
- [ ] Execute PUBLIC_RELEASE_PROCEDURE.md
- [ ] Publish to PyPI as `blueprint-ai`
- [ ] Fix Outpost dispatch.sh URL prepending bug
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI workflow to public repo
- [ ] Fix 3 pre-existing test failures
- [ ] Add validator check for generation metadata presence

## Identified Bugs

**Outpost dispatch.sh:**
```
Expected: Clone https://github.com/rgsuarez/blueprint.git
Actual:   Clone https://github.com/rgsuarez/https://github.com/rgsuarez/blueprint.git
```
Script prepends namespace to full URLs. Needs conditional handling.
