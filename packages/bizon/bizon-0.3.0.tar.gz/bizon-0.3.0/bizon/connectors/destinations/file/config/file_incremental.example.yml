name: dummy to file (incremental)

source:
  name: dummy

  name: file
  config:
    format: json

# How incremental sync works with file destination:
# 1. First run: Behaves like full_refresh (creates new file)
# 2. Subsequent runs: Only fetches records where cursor_field > last_run
# 3. New records are appended to the existing JSON file
# 4. Writes to temp file (_incremental.json) then appends to main file on finalize
