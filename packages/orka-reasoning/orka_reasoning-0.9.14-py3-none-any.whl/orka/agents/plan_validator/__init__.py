"""
Plan Validator Agent Module
============================

Meta-cognitive agent that validates and critiques proposed agent execution paths.
Designed to work in feedback loops with GraphScout or other planning agents.

The PlanValidatorAgent evaluates proposed paths across multiple dimensions:
- Completeness: Does the path address all aspects of the query?
- Efficiency: Is it optimal in terms of cost and latency?
- Safety: Are there any risky agent combinations or data flows?
- Coherence: Do the agents work well together in this sequence?
- Fallback: Are error cases and edge cases handled?
