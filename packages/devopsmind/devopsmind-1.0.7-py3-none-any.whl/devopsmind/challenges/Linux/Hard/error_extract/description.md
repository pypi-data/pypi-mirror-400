You are provided a log file named `app.log` that contains timestamps, log levels, and messages.

Your task:

 • Extract all ERROR log lines.
 • Remove duplicates (unique messages only).
 • Sort them chronologically by timestamp.
 • Output only timestamp and message (no log level) to a file named `errors.txt`.

This challenge tests your ability to manipulate structured log data using classic Linux text tools such as grep, awk, sort, and uniq.
