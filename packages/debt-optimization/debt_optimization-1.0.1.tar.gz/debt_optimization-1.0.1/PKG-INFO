# Debt Optimization — Tyrion Lannister Debt‑Paying Optimization (TL‑DPO)

A compact, extensible Python framework implementing the "Tyrion Lannister Debt‑Paying Optimization" (TL‑DPO) meta‑heuristic and utilities for Neural Architecture Search (NAS). TL‑DPO takes controlled "debt" (accepting worse solutions), then repays and overshoots in the opposite direction, plus a learning step toward the best found solution. This repository provides:

- A domain‑agnostic TL‑DPO core (`core/debt_core.py`)
- A NAS integration with a stable continuous encoding (`architecture/neural_architecture.py`)
- An optimizer wrapper for NAS experiments (`optimizer/optimizer.py`)
- A learned surrogate adapter & simple multi‑fidelity evaluation (`evaluation/adapter.py`)
- Benchmarking and visualization scripts (`benchmarks/`)
- Unit tests and example scripts (`examples/`, `tests/`)

---

## Features

- Conditional debt moves, severity‑scaled repayment, and double payment (overshoot)
- Directional intelligence toward the global best solution
- Multi‑agent council consensus for population guidance
- Stable continuous architecture encoding and decoding for NAS
- Optional learned surrogate (FAST mode) and real training with successive halving (ACCURATE mode)
- Benchmarking harness with baselines (random, hill‑climber, genetic, regularized evolution)

---

## Installation

Recommended: editable install (for development):

```powershell
cd "C:\Documents\MHO LAB\debt_optimization"
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

Or install from the distribution wheel produced by `python -m build`:

```powershell
python -m pip install dist\debt_optimization-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Optional extras:

```powershell
pip install ".[full]"   # installs torch + matplotlib (if available for your platform)
```

---

## Quickstart

Run a short example (from the workspace parent folder):

```powershell
cd "C:\Documents\MHO LAB"
python -m debt_optimization.example_using_package
```

Or run the simple usage example directly:

```powershell
python -m debt_optimization.examples.simple_usage
```

Typical workflow in code:

```python
from debt_optimization import DebtOptimizer, EvaluationMode

opt = DebtOptimizer(mode=EvaluationMode.FAST, eval_budget=100, n_agents=3)
best_arch, best_fitness, history, evals = opt.search(max_iterations=100)
print(best_arch, best_fitness)
```

---

## Benchmarks & Visualization

Run the quick benchmark suite (FAST mode) comparing TL‑DPO to simple baselines:

```powershell
python -m debt_optimization.benchmarks.run_benchmarks
```

Visualize results (requires `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`):

```powershell
python -m debt_optimization.benchmarks.visualize_results benchmarks/results.csv
```

For rigorous NAS comparisons, integrate with NAS‑Bench datasets (recommended next step).

---

## Testing

Run unit tests with `pytest`:

```powershell
cd "C:\Documents\MHO LAB\debt_optimization"
pytest -q
```

The test suite includes core behavior checks, adapter tests, and optional visualization tests (skipped if plotting libs are unavailable).

---

## Publishing to PyPI

Build distributions and upload (TestPyPI recommended first):

```powershell
pip install --upgrade build twine
python -m build
twine check dist/*

# Upload to TestPyPI
$env:TWINE_USERNAME = "__token__"
$env:TWINE_PASSWORD = "pypi-...TESTTOKEN..."
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Upload to PyPI (when ready)
$env:TWINE_PASSWORD = "pypi-...PRODTOKEN..."
twine upload dist/*
```

Add a `pyproject.toml` and `MANIFEST.in` are already included for packaging.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and PRs are welcome. Suggested next improvements:

- Full ENAS controller or wrappers for public NAS algorithms
- Integration with NAS‑Bench datasets for reproducible comparison
- More comprehensive evaluation metrics (parameters, FLOPs, latency)
- CI pipeline to run tests and optional benchmarks

Please open an issue describing the feature or bug before sending significant changes.

If you want, I can also add a short usage guide page, CI workflow, or a reproducible benchmark notebook — tell me which next.
