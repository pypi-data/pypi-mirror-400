Aspose.3D for Python via .NET is a cross-platform class library that enables your applications to connect with prevalent 3D document formats automatically without the 3D modeling and rendering software being installed on the server. Aspose.3D API lets engineers read, convert, build, alter and control the substance of the 3D document formats.



3D API Features
-------------------------

Aspose.3D offers a wide arrange of features for creating, reading, manipulating and saving 3D files:

* Build the mesh of various 3D geometric shapes
* Create a 3D scene document
* Set up normals or UV on the Cube
* Format elements using 3D Transformations
* Share Mesh's geometry data between the multiple nodes
* Add Animation property to 3D scene document


Performance and Scalability
-----------------------------------

Aspose.3D for Python via .NET is designed to perform equally well on the server or client-side. Aspose.3D for Python via .NET is a single .NET library that can be deployed with any .NET application by simply copying it. You do not have to worry about other services or modules.



Supported Document Formats
-----------------------------------


Aspose.3D for Python supports `a wide range of formats for loading and saving documents <https://docs.aspose.com/3d/python-net/supported-file-formats/>`_, some of them are listed below: 

**Game**: 3DS, ASE, DAE, FBX, U3D, X
**VR/AR**: USD, USDZ, VRML
**CAD**: DXF, RVM, JT
**Web and PDF**: HTML5, glTF, glB, PDF
**3D Printing**: 3MF, AMF, OBJ, STL, 
**Point Cloud**: XYZ, OBJ, PLY, PCD


Detect 3D Format Programming Sample 
-------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   import aspose.threed as a3d
   # For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-3d/Aspose.3D-for-.NET
   # Detect the format of a 3D file
   inputFormat = a3d.FileFormat.detect("document.fbx");
   # Display the file format
   print("File Format: " + str(inputFormat))


Creating a 3D Scene Document: Programming Samples 
--------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   import aspose.threed as a3d
   # For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-3d/Aspose.3D-for-.NET
   # The path to the documents directory.
   # Create an object of the Scene class
   scene = a3d.Scene()
   # Save 3D scene document
   scene.Save("document.fbx", a3d.FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII)


Create a 3D PDF with a Cylinder
------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from aspose.threed import Scene
   from aspose.threed.entities import Cylinder
   from aspose.threed.shading import PhongMaterial
   from aspose.threed.formats import PdfSaveOptions, PdfLightingScheme, PdfRenderMode
   # Create a new scene
   scene = Scene()
   # Create a cylinder child node
   cylinder = scene.root_node.create_child_node("cylinder", Cylinder())
   cylinder.material = PhongMaterial()
   # Set rendering mode and lighting scheme
   opt = PdfSaveOptions()
   opt.lighting_scheme = PdfLightingScheme.CAD
   opt.render_mode = PdfRenderMode.SHADED_ILLUSTRATION
   # Save in the PDF format
   scene.save("output_out.pdf", opt)
