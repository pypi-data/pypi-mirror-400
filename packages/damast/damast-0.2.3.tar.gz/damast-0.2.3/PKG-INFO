# damast: Creation of reproducible data processing pipelines

The main purpose of this library is to faciliate the reusability of data and data processing pipelines.
For this, damast introduces a means to associate metadata with data frames and enables consistency checking.

To ensure semantic consistency, transformation steps in a pipeline can be annotated with
allowed data ranges for inputs and outputs, as well as units.

```
class LatLonTransformer(PipelineElement):
    """
    The LatLonTransformer will consume a lat(itude) and a lon(gitude) column and perform
    cyclic normalization. It will add four columns to a dataframe, namely lat_x, lat_y, lon_x, lon_y.
    """
    @damast.core.describe("Lat/Lon cyclic transformation")
    @damast.core.input({
        "lat": {"unit": "deg"},
        "lon": {"unit": "deg"}
    })
    @damast.core.output({
        "lat_x": {"value_range": MinMax(-1.0, 1.0)},
        "lat_y": {"value_range": MinMax(-1.0, 1.0)},
        "lon_x": {"value_range": MinMax(-1.0, 1.0)},
        "lon_y": {"value_range": MinMax(-1.0, 1.0)}
    })
    def transform(self, df: AnnotatedDataFrame) -> AnnotatedDataFrame:
        lat_cyclic_transformer = CycleTransformer(features=["lat"], n=180.0)
        lon_cyclic_transformer = CycleTransformer(features=["lon"], n=360.0)

        _df = lat_cyclic_transformer.fit_transform(df=df)
        _df = lon_cyclic_transformer.fit_transform(df=_df)
        return _df
```

Pipeline can also be designed with join / merge operations:

```
class JoinByTimestamp(PipelineElement):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @damast.core.describe("Join data for matching timestamp")
    @damast.core.input({
                           "timestamp": {},
                           "lon": {},
                           "lat": {},
                       })
    @damast.core.input({
                            "timestamp": {},
                            "lat": {},
                            "lon": {},
                            "event_type": {}
                        }, label='other'
    )
    @damast.core.output({ "event_type": {}})
    def transform(self, df: AnnotatedDataFrame, other: AnnotatedDataFrame) -> AnnotatedDataFrame:
        other_timestamp = self.get_name('timestamp', datasource='other')
        df_timestamp = self.get_name('timestamp')

        df._dataframe = df.join(other._dataframe, left_on=df_timestamp, right_on=other_timestamp)
        return df
```

## Installation and Development Setup

Firstly, you will want to create you an isolated development environment for Python, that being conda or venv-based.
The following will go through a venv based setup.

Let us assume you operate with a 'workspace' directory for this project:

```
    cd workspace
```

Here, you will create a virtual environment.
Get an overview over venv (command):

```
    python -m venv --help
```

Create your venv and activate it:
```
    python -m venv damast-venv
    source damast-venv/bin/activate
```

### From PyPi

To install the package from pypi use:

```
    pip install damast
```

Note that machine-learning related elements required additional dependencies, and to install
keras and all supported backends (jax, torch, tensorflow) you can use:

```
    pip install damast[ml]
```

### From Source

Clone the repo and install:

```
    git clone https://github.com/simula/damast
    cd damast
    pip install -e ".[test,dev]"
```

or alternatively:
```
    pip install damast[test,dev]
```

## Docker Container

If you prefer to work or start with a docker container you can build it using the provided [Dockerfile](https://github.com/simula/damast/blob/main/Dockerfile)
```
    docker build -t damast:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

To enter the container:
```
    docker run -it --rm damast:latest /bin/bash
```

## Usage

To get the usage documentation it is easiest to check the published documentation [here](https://simula.github.io/damast/README.html).

Otherwise, you can also locally generate the latest documentation once you installed the package:
```
    tox -e build_docs
```
Then open the documentation with a browser:
```
    <yourbrowser> _build/html/index.html
```


## Testing

Install the project and use the predefined default test environment:

    tox -e py
