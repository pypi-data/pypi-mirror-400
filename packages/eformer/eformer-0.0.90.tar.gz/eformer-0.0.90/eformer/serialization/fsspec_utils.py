    Uses fsspec to support multiple storage backends including local filesystem,

    Args:
        url: URL or path to check. Supports various protocols (file://, gs://, s3://, etc.).
        **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to fsspec.core.url_to_fs (e.g., credentials).

    Returns:
        True if the path exists, False otherwise.

    Example:

            cloud storage URLs (gs://, s3://, etc.).

    Note:
        Uses exist_ok=True, so no error is raised if the directory already exists.
        This makes it safe to call multiple times on the same path.

    Args:
        url: URL or path with potential glob patterns and/or brace expressions.

    Yields:
        Expanded URLs/paths matching the pattern.

    Example:

    Uses fsspec for cross-platform and cloud-compatible file removal.

    Args:

            and cloud storage URLs (gs://, s3://, etc.).
        recursive: If True, remove directories and their contents recursively.

    Uses async operations when the filesystem supports it (e.g., gcsfs, s3fs),
    otherwise falls back to synchronous removal. Useful for non-blocking I/O
    in async contexts.

    Args:
        url: URL or path of the file/directory to remove. Supports local paths
            and cloud storage URLs (gs://, s3://, etc.).

    Returns:

    Note:
        - For AsyncFileSystem backends (GCS, S3), uses native async _rm method.
        - For synchronous backends (local filesystem), blocks during removal.
        - Prefer this over remove() when running in async contexts for better
          performance with cloud storage.
