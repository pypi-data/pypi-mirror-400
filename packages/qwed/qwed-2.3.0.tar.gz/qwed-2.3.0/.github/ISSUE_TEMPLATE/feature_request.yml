        ⚠️ **Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/QWED-AI/qwed-verification/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)** to understand QWED's philosophy.
        
        - QWED is **deterministic-first** - LLMs are translators, not verifiers
        - Enterprise features (audit, SSO, RBAC) belong in a separate repo
