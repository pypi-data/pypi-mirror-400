## ❓ Why `mcpv`?

Have you ever felt this while using AI Agents (Antigravity, Cursor)?
> *"Why is it so heavy?"*  
> *"It froze again..."*  
> *"Why are the token costs so high?"*

`mcpv` is not just a tool. It is a **Turbo Engine** for your agent.

<br>

### 🏎️ Overwhelming Performance Difference

| Feature | 😫 Without `mcpv` (Before) | ⚡ With `mcpv` (After) | 📈 Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | No GPU, Laggy UI | **Forced GPU Acceleration, Smooth** | **100x** Perceived Speed |
| **Loading** | Wait 60s+ every time | **0.1s Instant Start** (Lazy Load) | **Zero** Latency |
| **Cost** | Resend full code every time | **Auto-block Duplicates** (Smart Cache) | **90%** Savings |

## ✨ 3 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Booster Injection (Physical Acceleration)
**"Unlock hardware limits with one line"**
- **Forced GPU Activation**: Injects hidden rendering acceleration flags (`--enable-gpu-rasterization`).
- **Permission Bypass**: Drops Admin rights to fix drag-and-drop & UI bugs, and bypasses permission requests (Error 740) using `RunAsInvoker`.
- **Zombie Process Killer**: Automatically cleans up ghost processes occupying ports.

### 2️⃣ Smart Valve (Cost Defense)
**"Smart wallet protector that saves for you"**
- Detects the massive context data (`repomix`) that agents habitually request.
- **First request: Allowed** (Full context provided).
- **Subsequent requests: Blocked** with a 10-token **"Already cached"** message.
- Physically blocks accidental token bombs.

### 3️⃣ Gateway Hijacking (Secure Vault)
**"Stop struggling with complex configs"**
- **Zero-Latency Startup**: Only scans directories when the agent actually requests them. No timeouts on large repos.
- Automatically migrates existing complex MCP settings to a secure Vault.
- Original config is safely backed up to `mcp_config.original.json`.
- The agent talks only to `mcpv`, but all tools work perfectly behind the scenes.

## 🛠️ Verified Recommended Setup

Verified MCP server configuration used by the developer. It creates the best synergy when used with `mcpv`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rube": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://rube.app/mcp"]
    },
    "open-aware": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://open-aware.qodo.ai/mcp"]
    },
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp", "--api-key", "PUT_IN_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "mcp-server-neon": {
      "disabled": false,
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.neon.tech/sse"],
      "env": {
        "NEON_API_KEY": "NEVERCHANGE_DONT_PUT_IN_ANYTHING_ELSE_THAN_ME_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## � Recommended System Rule

**Add this rule to your agent's system prompt (e.g., .cursorrules, .antigravityrules).**  
This ensures the agent uses `mcpv` correctly without redundant requests.

> **[System Instruction]**
>
> **Session Start**: At the very beginning of the conversation, you MUST call `get_initial_context` tool immediately. This is your only way to understand the project structure.
>
> **Context Management**: Do NOT call `get_initial_context` again in the same session unless the user explicitly asks for a "refresh" with `force=True`. The proxy will block redundant requests.
>
> **File Access**: After reading the initial context map, use `read_file` to inspect specific files needed for the task.

## �🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python & uv**: Uses `uv` for clean, isolated virtual environments to prevent dependency hell.
- **FastMCP**: Built on top of the FastMCP framework for speed.
- **Gateway Pattern**: It backs up your original config and routes traffic through the proxy securely.

## 📦 Installation

Choose the method that fits your needs.

### Option A: The "It Just Works" Method (Recommended for most users)
If you have Python installed and added to PATH.

```powershell
# 1. Install from PyPI
pip install mcpv

# 2. Setup Gateway & Booster
mcpv install

# 3. Done! 
# Look for the "Antigravity Boost (mcpv)" shortcut on your Desktop.

```

---

### Option B: The "Rock-Solid" Method (Using `uv`)

Use this method if your Python environment is messy or you want complete isolation.

#### 1. Clean up existing processes

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Stop-Process -Name "python" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

```

#### 2. Create Virtual Environment & Install

```powershell
# Install uv (if needed)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm [https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1](https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1) | iex"

# Create .venv and install mcpv
uv venv
uv pip install mcpv

```

#### 3. Register & Lock

This registers the **isolated virtual environment** into Antigravity's config.

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m mcpv install --force

```

#### 4. Run

Launch **`Antigravity Boost (mcpv)`** from your Desktop.

---

## 🛠️ Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `mcpv install` | Installs the gateway and creates the Desktop shortcut. |
| `mcpv install --force` | Forces installation even if only 1 MCP server exists. |
| `mcpv start` | Starts the server (Used internally by Antigravity). |
| `mcpv --help` | Show help message. |

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

#### Q. "File access denied" or "Failed to remove file" during update?

This means `mcpv.exe` or `Antigravity` is still running.

1. Close Antigravity.
2. Run: `Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force` in PowerShell.
3. Try installing again.

#### Q. I installed it, but I don't see the Shortcut.

The shortcut is created on your **Desktop**. If not, check the installation logs. You can create it manually by running `mcpv install` again.
