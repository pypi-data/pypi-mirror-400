"""
This package contains the hansken extraction plugin framework.

It is split into four submodules:

  * `api`, which contains the api of the classes that are used when implementing an extraction plugin.
  * `framework`, which contains the generated gRPC code to communicate with the remote (Hansken).
  * `runtime`, which contains implementations of the api.
  * `test_framework`, which contains code to test extraction plugins with known input and outputs.
