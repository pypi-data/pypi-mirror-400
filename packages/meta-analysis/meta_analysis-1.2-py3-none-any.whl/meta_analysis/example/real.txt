# Comments are allowed, everything after # is ignored.
# First list below your propositional variables, and only variables. Variables can use letters and underscores [A-Za-z_]. 
# Variables must not contain numbers and symbols such as | and /. They are not case-sensitive when used in constraints.
# STUDY must not be used as a variable even as a part of their name such as STUDYING. 
# The following keywords must not be used as variables: SAMPLE, SIZE, MAXITER, STOPPING, GTOL, OR, NOT, NEG, BIAS, but they could be part of their names such as NOTE.

# You can separate variables by commas, empty spaces on put the on new lines as seen below

CA  # Cancer manifested within 12 months. 
REC # Cancer detected during routine evaluation when unprovoked VTE was diagnosed.
ESC # Cancer detected during extensive screening when unprovoked VTE was diagnosed.
RES # Routine evaluation yielded suspicious results in respect to cancer when unprovoked VTE was diagnosed.
ESS # Extensive screening yielded suspicious results in respect to cancer when unprovoked VTE was diagnosed.

stopping 1e-6 # It will take a while to compute the result using the default precision (1e-6). Change it here for quick testing (not above 1e-4), or to achieve a higher precision.

# Now list all constraints for your study on separate lines. They must be consistent. Therefore, make sure to split experimental studies into two: 
# one for the intervention sample and one for the control sample. Additionally, constraints may not force an atomic sentence to be zero.
# There are three types of constraints: (1) The probability of a conjunction of literals equals a number, 
# (2) the probability of a disjunctive normal form equals a number, and (3) the probability of a conditional equals a number.
# The probability must be a positive number between 0 and 1. The number has a dot for decimals, but must not have any commas or spaces included.
# Only the first number included on the line is taken as the probability. The number cannot use the scientific notation; use the decimal form. 
# However, you may want to give probability as a fraction to avoid inconsistencies. If some study subject leave, this must be ignored to avoid inconsistencies. 
# Use / with any or no spaces between it and two numbers to indicate a fraction. For example, 1/5, 1 / 5 and 1 / 10,000 are all acceptable.
