"""
Thread pool executor caching for Fast LangGraph.

This module provides a cached executor pool that eliminates the overhead
of creating and destroying thread pools for each graph invocation.

Key optimization: Reuse ThreadPoolExecutor instances across invocations
instead of creating new ones each time, which saves ~20ms per invocation.
