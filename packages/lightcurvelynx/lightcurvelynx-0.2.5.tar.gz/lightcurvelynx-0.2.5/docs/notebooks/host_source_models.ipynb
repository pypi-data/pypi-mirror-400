    "# Simulating Combinations of Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "For some extragalatic studies, the user might be interested in simulating the *combination* of fluxes coming from multiple objects. The simplest case of this is an object and its host galaxy. However, other combinations, such as two blended objects, use the same mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "LightCurveLynx provides a general purpose class `AdditiveMultiObjectModel` that produces the combined flux densities from multiple models. This class can be used to simulate host/object combinations, unresolved sources, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The AdditiveMultiObjectModel Node\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AdditiveMultiObjectModel` node model takes a list of `BasePhysicalModel` objects and returns the sum of their flux densities. As an example, let's create a source that is a sinwave (with magnitude 3.0) in front of a static host (of brightness 5). "

It is important to note that, when using an `AdditiveMultiObjectModel`, the RA and dec (and other parameters) saved will be the one assigned to the outer-most object.\n",
