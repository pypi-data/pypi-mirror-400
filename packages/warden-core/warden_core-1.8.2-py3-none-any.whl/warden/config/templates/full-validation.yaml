# Full Validation Pipeline Template
# Focus: Comprehensive testing with all 6 frames
# Use case: Pre-production validation, CI/CD pipelines

version: "1.0"
name: "Full Validation Pipeline"

# All 6 validation frames (executed by priority)
frames:
  - security       # Priority: CRITICAL (runs first, blocker)
  - chaos          # Priority: HIGH (resilience testing)
  - fuzz           # Priority: MEDIUM (edge cases)
  - property       # Priority: MEDIUM (idempotency)
  - architectural  # Priority: MEDIUM (design patterns)
  - stress         # Priority: LOW (runs last)

# Execution order (automatic priority-based):
# Sequential mode: security → chaos → fuzz/property/architectural → stress
# Parallel mode:
#   Group 1: security (critical) - runs alone
#   Group 2: chaos (high) - runs alone
#   Group 3: fuzz + property + architectural (medium) - parallel
#   Group 4: stress (low) - runs alone

settings:
  fail_fast: false  # Run all frames even if one fails
  timeout: 600      # 10 minutes for comprehensive scan
  parallel: true    # Run frames in parallel (grouped by priority)
