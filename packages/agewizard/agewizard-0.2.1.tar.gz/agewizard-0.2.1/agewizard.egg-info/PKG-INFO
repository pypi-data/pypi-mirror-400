# 🧙‍♂️ Agewizard: The Absolute Age & DOB Powerhouse for Python

**Agewizard** is a premium, developer-first Python library designed to handle all aspects of age calculation, date of birth (DOB) analysis, and life-stage classification. Built with a focus on **strict validation**, **global compatibility**, and **magic-like simplicity**, it provides the most comprehensive toolset for modern Python applications.

Whether you're building a simple registration form with 18+ verification or a complex fintech app requiring precise date metrics, Agewizard ensures your logic is bulletproof and your code remains clean.

---

## 🚀 Key Value Propositions

- **Total Reliability**: Strict internal validation catches "fake dates" (like month 13 or Feb 30) before they reach your database.
- **Global Ready**: Native support for any date format (`DD-MM-YYYY`, `MM.DD.YYYY`, `YYYY/MM/DD`).
- **Developer Experience**: A fluent API that follows the **Zen of Python**—it just works.
- **Micro-Services Ready**: Zero external dependencies. Just pure Python power.

## 🛠 Installation

Install the latest version directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install -U agewizard
```

---

## 📖 Comprehensive Feature Guide

### 1. Robust Date Parsing & Strict Validation
Most libraries crash when they see an invalid date. Agewizard validates everything. It automatically normalizes separators (`-`, `.`, `/`, or spaces).

```python
from agewizard import Age

# --- Example: Catching Invalid Input ---
try:
    # Agewizard knows February doesn't have 30 days
    user = Age("2021-02-30") 
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Wizard Alert: {e}") # Output: Invalid date components in '2021-02-30': day is out of range for month
```

---

### 2. Global Format Support (Locales)
Handle users from any country by specifying their preferred date format.

```python
# UK/London Format (Day First)
uk_person = Age("31-12-1995", date_format="DD-MM-YYYY")

# US/New York Format (Month First)
us_person = Age("12.31.1995", date_format="MM.DD.YYYY")

# Standard Format (Auto-detected if it looks like YYYY-MM-DD or DD-MM-YYYY)
standard_person = Age("1995-15-05") # Automatically handles it
```

---

### 3. One-Line Age Verification (18+/21+)
Built-in methods for the most common use case in web development: account eligibility.

```python
person = Age("2010-01-01")

# The "One-Word" Verification
if person.is_adult():
    print("Welcome home!")
else:
    print(f"Denied! Come back in {18 - person.years} years.")

# Custom thresholds (e.g., for Alcohol/Tobacco laws or Senior discounts)
print(person.is_adult(min_age=21)) # False
print(person.is_over(65))         # False
```

---

### 4. Deep Metrics (Days, Weeks, Months)
Go beyond just years. Get the exact weight of a person's life in various units.

```python
p = Age("1990-05-15")

print(f"Life in Days: {p.days}")      # Total days since birth
print(f"Life in Weeks: {p.weeks}")    # Total weeks since birth
print(f"Life in Months: {p.months}")  # Total months since birth
print(f"Human Format: {p.readable}") # Output: "34 years, 7 months, 24 days"
```

---

### 5. Zodiac & Magic Insights
Add personality to your app with automatic star sign detection.

```python
p = Age("1985-08-23")

print(f"Star Sign: {p.zodiac}") # Output: Virgo
print(f"Next Birthday Weekday: {p.next_birthday_weekday}") # What day is the party?
print(f"Days to B-Day: {p.next_birthday_days}") # The countdown
```

---

### 6. Life Stage Classification
Agewizard can automatically categorize a person based on their age.

| Age Range | Category |
|-----------|----------|
| 0 - 2     | Infant   |
| 3 - 12    | Child    |
| 13 - 19   | Teen     |
| 20 - 64   | Adult    |
| 65+       | Senior   |

```python
print(Age("2022-01-01").category) # Infant
print(Age("2005-01-01").category) # Teen
```

---

## 🖥 Production Examples

### Interactive Form with Error Recovery
```python
from agewizard import Age

def register_user():
    print("=== Welcome to the Magic Portal ===")
    dob_input = input("Enter your Birthday (DD-MM-YYYY): ")
    
    try:
        user = Age(dob_input, date_format="DD-MM-YYYY")
        
        if not user.is_adult():
            print(f"❌ Error: You are a {user.category}. This portal is for Adults only.")
            return

        print(f"✅ Success! You are {user.years} years old.")
        print(f"Fun Fact: You were born on a {user.birth_date.strftime('%A')}.")
        print(f"Your star sign is: {user.zodiac} 🌌")
        
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"💥 Invalid Input: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    register_user()
```

---

### Comparing Two Dates
```python
from agewizard import compare_ages

# Who is older?
story = compare_ages("1990-01-01", "1995-05-15")
print(story) # "Person 1 is older by approx 5 years (1960 days)."
```
