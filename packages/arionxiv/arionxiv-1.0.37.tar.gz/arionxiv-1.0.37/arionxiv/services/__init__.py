"""
Services module for ArionXiv

This module contains all the core service classes for paper analysis,
database operations, configuration management, and more.

NOTE: Services are lazily imported to avoid requiring fastapi for CLI usage.
The auth_service requires fastapi and is only needed for server/API functionality.
