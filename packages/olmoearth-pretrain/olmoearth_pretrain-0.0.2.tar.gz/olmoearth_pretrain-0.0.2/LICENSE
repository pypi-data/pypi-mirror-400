OlmoEarth Artifact License

By exercising the rights granted to you under this OlmoEarth Artifact License
("Agreement"), you accept and agree to its terms and conditions and enter into this
Agreement with The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence ("Ai2"). All references
to "you" herein means both an individual and legal entity that an individual is acting
on behalf of.

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Ai2 grants you permission, free of
charge, to use the machine learning artifacts, materials, and documentation provided by
Ai2 under this Agreement as follows (collectively, "Artifacts"):

- Model weights, including architecture and parameters ("Model");
- Associated dataset or collection of data in connection with the Model ("Dataset"); and/or
- Associated software to process and run the Dataset and Model, including code in
  source or binary form for training, inference, and evaluation ("Code").

1. Use Rights

Subject to the terms in Section 2 and 3 below, you may:

(a) Use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute the Artifacts, in whole or in part;
(b) Create any other machine learning models, datasets, and derivative works that are
    derived from or based on the Artifacts, including by (i) transfer of patterns of
    the weights, parameters, operations, or outputs of the Model, (ii) generating
    outputs of the Model to produce synthetic data, and (iii) using Code to prepare any
    work of authorship (collectively, "Derivatives"); and
(c) Publish and share Derivatives.

2. Use Restrictions

You will not (and will not encourage, permit, or facilitate any others to) use any
portion of the Artifacts or Derivatives for the following purposes:

(a) Any military and defense-related applications and use cases, including without
    limitation, for weapons development, military operations, intelligence gathering,
    or human surveillance and policing activities.
(b) Any extractive activities, operations and use cases involving the removal of raw
    materials from the earth, including without limitation, to plan or facilitate the
    extraction of oil, natural gas and minerals through activities such as drilling,
    mining, and deforestation.

3. Distribution

In any distribution of the Artifacts or Derivatives:

(a) You will cite Ai2 as the source of the Artifacts in any distribution of Artifacts
    or Derivatives.
(b) If you distribute any portion of the Artifacts, you will either link to or provide
    a copy of this Agreement to all third party recipients.
(c) If you distribute any Derivatives, you may add your own intellectual property
    notices and apply other licenses and terms of use, provided that you include and
    require the use restrictions in Section 2 in all downstream distribution unless Ai2
    provides written approval otherwise.

4. Termination

This Agreement will automatically terminate with immediate effect and without notice to
you in the following circumstances:

(a) Your breach of the use restrictions in Section 2 and any other terms and conditions
    herein; or
(b) If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in a lawsuit against any person
    or entity asserting that the Artifacts or any portion thereof directly or
    indirectly infringe any patent, except where a lawsuit is filed in response to a
    corresponding lawsuit first brought against you.

For the avoidance of doubt, Ai2 may also offer the Artifacts under separate terms and
conditions or stop distributing the Artifacts at any time; however, doing so will not
terminate this Agreement. You may continue to use the Artifacts under this Agreement
unless it is terminated in accordance with the circumstances expressly stated herein.

5. Rights Not Covered

This Agreement does not cover any patents or trademarks associated with the Artifacts,
including with respect to any individual items of information and materials that are
included or incorporated within a Dataset ("Contents"). Such Contents may be factual
data or independent works such as text, images, audio, and audio visual material.
Contents may be subject to other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection,
privacy, or personality rights, and this Agreement does not cover such rights. The use
rights in Section 1 expressly exclude any and all other rights that may apply to the
Contents of a Dataset.

6. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

(a) THE ARTIFACTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", "AS AVAILABLE", AND "WITH ALL FAULTS", WITHOUT
    ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE
    OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. AI2 MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
    WARRANTIES AS TO THE RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
    FUNCTIONALITY, OR UTILITY OF ANY ARTIFACTS. ANY USE OF THE ARTIFACTS IS AT YOUR
    SOLE RISK AND DISCRETION. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR (1) CLEARING ANY THIRD
    PARTY RIGHTS THAT MAY APPLY TO OR BE EMBODIED IN ANY ARTIFACTS, INCLUDING ANY
    CONTENTS IN A DATASET; (2) OBTAINING ANY NECESSARY RIGHTS, LICENSES, CONSENTS, OR
    PERMISSIONS REQUIRED FOR YOUR USE OF THE ARTIFACTS; AND (3) PERFORMING ANY DUE
    DILIGENCE ON THE ARTIFACTS TO VERIFY SUITABILITY FOR YOUR INTENDED USE.

(b) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, IN NO EVENT WILL AI2 BE
    LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR OTHER LIABILITY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER,
    WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION
    WITH THE ARTIFACTS OR YOUR USE THEREOF.

(c) The disclaimers and limitations of liability set forth above will be interpreted in
    a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, constitute an absolute disclaimer
    and waiver of all liability.

7. Other Agreements

If you have entered into a separate written agreement with Ai2 regarding your use of
the specific Artifacts that are subject to this Agreement ("Other Agreement"), the
terms of such Other Agreement will supplement the terms herein. To the extent of any
conflict between the terms of the Other Agreement and this Agreement, the Other
Agreement will take precedence.

8. Miscellaneous

If any term or provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will
automatically be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. To
the extent it cannot be reformed, it will be severed from this Agreement, and the
remaining terms and conditions will remain in full force and effect. Any delay or
failure by Ai2 to take any action or enforce any breach of this Agreement will not be
deemed as a waiver or consent by Ai2. No term or provision of this Agreement will be
waived by Ai2 unless expressly agreed in writing. Nothing in this Agreement constitutes
as a limitation of any privileges, immunities, and rights that apply to you or Ai2
under applicable laws, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.
