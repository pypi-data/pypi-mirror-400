**🖥️ Qiskit Connector® - Seamless Real-Time Connector for IBM Quantum Computing QPU**

Qiskit Connector® is quantum computing open-source SDK extension. The Qiskit Connector® transforms how quantum developers connect to IBM Quantum backends by automating every step of the authentication, plan detection, and backend selection process. Instead of writing extensive boilerplate setup code for each project, developers can now seamlessly authenticate, dynamically detect whether they are using an `Open` or `Paid` plan, and instantly access the optimal backend `QPU`resource which is least-busy using a single intuitive keyword: `backend`. The connector intelligently manages quantum computing plan environment variables and Qiskit runtime service configuration for sticky reusability of QPU resources from the backend, allowing quantum developers to streamline connection workflows and immediately focus on building, testing, and scaling quantum applications. 
<br><br>
By eliminating manual configurations and connection complexities, Qiskit Connector empowers developers to reduce onboarding time, minimize human error, and accelerate quantum solution delivery. The tool is especially valuable for production-grade quantum development where agility, repeatability, and secure backend access are critical. Whether working in research environments, building enterprise-grade quantum solutions, or designing novel quantum algorithms, developers can now concentrate on high-value tasks without being slowed down by infrastructure setup challenges.
<br><br>
⚛️This package performs the following:
- Loads environment variables from config file (e.g. `.env` if you are local) or load it remotely(depending on detection) to configure your IBM Quantum account plan and make the `backend` object available within your quantum application code for reuse in real-time.
- Detects your active plan (Open, Standard, Premium, Dedicated) and sets up the correct channel/instance.
- It has (`qiskit_smart`) to establish connectivity, then to verify QPU resources using (`qpu_verify`), and retrieve a ready-to-use backend using (`connector()`). Presents you with the least-busy backend QPU to run your quantum application code in realtime.

#### 📋 Built-in classes & functions

These functions are available after you import the module:

```python
from qiskit_connector import QConnectorV2 as connector
from qiskit_connector import QPlanV2 as plan
```
- **`connector()`**  
  **Primary Integration Point:** Seamlessly initializes your IBM Quantum account, selects the optimal QPU (or the first available device for open/paid plans), and emits a clear diagnostics summary. It returns a fully configured `backend` object that you can immediately pass to Qiskit’s sampler, estimator, transpiler, or any circuit execution API—so you can focus on your quantum workflows rather than connection boilerplate.

- **`plan()`**  
  **Subscription Plan Resolver:** Automatically evaluates your environment configuration (via `.env` or system variables) to identify whether you’re operating under the **Open Plan** or a **Paid Plan**. This guarantees that your code consistently targets the correct IBM Quantum service tier, eliminating manual plan management and minimizing configuration drift.

#### 🔧 Installation
###### It is recommended that you use `pip` for installation - a common best practice.
```bash
pip install qiskit-connector
```

This will also pull in functionalities powered by Qiskit SDK:
- `qiskit>=2.0.0`  
  

and any other Qiskit dependencies. (Qiskit 1.x is not supported).

#### 🗂️ Variable Setup
🔐 [Security Practices](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-best-practices): Do not check-in to version control any `environment variable config file` or any variable setup file. The best security practice is to add it to your `.gitignore` or to accessible `vault`. During local development, create a file named `.env` at your project root and ensure it is named on your `.gitignore`. The connector will automatically load it. Use the template below as the content of your .env file or variable setup config file. Copy and paste it then supply the values.
