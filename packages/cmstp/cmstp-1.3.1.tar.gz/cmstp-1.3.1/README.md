# cmstp - computer setup

Contains anything related to setting up a new computer (desktop) system.

# Disclaimer - Use at your own risk
This project is currently (12.2025) coded solely by me. As a junior developer, there is probably a lot that can be improved and although I have tested each task, there may be some unforeseen issues. Please use with caution and report any issues you find (see the [contributing](https://github.com/ArturoRoberti/cmstp/blob/main/README.md#contributing) section).

During this project's initial development, I recommend using it solely on fresh machines.

> **NOTE**: The installation of `pipx` via `pip` (as opposed to `apt`) is recommended on older versions, as the `apt` version is often outdated.
