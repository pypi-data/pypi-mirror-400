        Performs latency compensation on signal using the signalSlope and signal's latency to determine

        this function only does the math required for latency compensation.

        Important: The signalSlope must be the rate of change of the signal. If it is not the latency

        Waits for new data on all provided signals up to timeout.
        This API is typically used with CANivore Bus signals as they will be synced using the
        CANivore Timesync feature and arrive simultaneously. Signals on a roboRIO bus cannot
        be synced and may require a significantly longer blocking call to receive all signals.

        Note that CANivore Timesync requires Phoenix Pro.

        This can also be used with a timeout of zero to refresh many signals at once, which
        is faster than calling refresh() on every signal. This is equivalent to calling refresh_all.

        If a signal arrives multiple times while waiting, such as when *not* using CANivore
        Timesync, the newest signal data is fetched. Additionally, if this function times out,
        the newest signal data is fetched for all signals (when possible). We recommend checking
        the individual status codes using self.status when this happens.
