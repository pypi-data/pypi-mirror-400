   "Commercial Use" means any use of the Software (i) in connection with any business activity, 
   (ii) in a production environment serving end users, (iii) that generates revenue directly 
   or indirectly, (iv) by or for any commercial entity, (v) that provides competitive

   "Licensor" refers to Klira AI Technologies and its authorized representatives.
   "API Key" means the unique authentication token issued by Klira AI for accessing the Software 
   and associated services.

     technical protection measures, or authentication mechanisms
