Daniele Gasparri, January 2026


# Plot data

This sub-program provides a simple and efficient way to visualize data from ASCII files generated by SPAN. It supports text files with space- or tab-separated columns, where the first row must contain column names.


How to Use
1) Select a text file and click "Load".
2) The program will automatically detect the column names.
3) Choose which columns to use for the X and Y axes.
4) Click "Plot" to visualize the data in an IDL-style plot.


Customization Options
You can modify the plot appearance by:
- Adding error bars.
- Enabling a logarithmic scale.
- Applying a linear fit (basic fitting without considering uncertainties).
- Customizing labels, axis ranges, font size, marker size, and colors.
- Choosing whether to display the legend.


Saving the Plot
The generated plot can be saved as a high-resolution PNG image in the main SPAN directory.


Error Handling
If an error occurs, the program will display a warning message.
