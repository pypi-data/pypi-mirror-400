This project provides convenient ways to use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
within a [CMake](https://cmake.org/) project. The package can be discovered from a specific range of
versions on Linux, macOS or Windows using the
[find_package](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html)
function:

```cmake
find_package(Sphinx 7.3.7 REQUIRED)
```

A ``sphinx_add_docs`` function is provided as a convenience for adding a target
for generating documentation with Sphinx.

```cmake
sphinx_add_docs(docs ALL)
```
