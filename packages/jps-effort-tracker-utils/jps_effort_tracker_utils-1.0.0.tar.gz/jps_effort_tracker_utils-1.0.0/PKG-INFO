## Overview

**jps-effort-tracker-utils** is a Python package that provides command-line tools for tracking tasks and effort. It helps you organize your daily work by managing tasks with detailed attributes including priority levels, effort estimates, due dates, status tracking, and integration with issue trackers.

Tasks are stored in YAML files organized by date, making it easy to track your work history and transfer incomplete tasks between days automatically.

## Features

✅ **Task Management**: Add, view, delete, and update tasks via simple CLI commands

✅ **Rich Task Attributes**:
- Task ID (auto-generated timestamps)
- Title and description
- Priority levels (1-5)
- Due dates
- Status tracking (pending, in-progress, completed, deleted, not started)
- Effort estimates (in minutes)
- Level of effort categories (Easy, Medium, Hard, Complex)
- Issue tracker integration
- Issue types (enhancement, bugfix, documentation, etc.)

✅ **Smart Features**:
- Automatic transfer of incomplete tasks to the next day
- Date-based task file organization
- Colored console output for better readability
- YAML-based storage for easy inspection and editing
- Configurable task storage directory

✅ **Developer-Friendly**:
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- Type hints throughout
- Rich console output with Typer CLI framework
- Detailed logging

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, see [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

### Quick Install

```bash
pip install jps-effort-tracker-utils
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jai-python3/effort-tracker-utils.git
cd effort-tracker-utils
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# View all available commands
jps-effort-tracker --help

# Add a new task
jps-effort-tracker add-task

# View tasks for today
jps-effort-tracker view-tasks

# Delete a task
jps-effort-tracker delete-task

# Show version
jps-effort-tracker version
```

## Usage

All commands are accessed through the main `jps-effort-tracker` CLI tool.

### Add Task

Interactively add a new task with all properties:

```bash
jps-effort-tracker add-task
```

With options:

```bash
jps-effort-tracker add-task --config-file /path/to/config.yaml --verbose
```

**Options:**
- `--config-file`, `-c`: Configuration file path (default: built-in config)
- `--task-file`, `-t`: Specific task file to use (default: today's file)
- `--logfile`, `-l`: Log file path
- `--outdir`, `-o`: Output directory for logs
- `--verbose`, `-v`: Enable verbose output

### View Tasks

View and browse your tasks:

```bash
jps-effort-tracker view-tasks
```

Select a task number to view full details, or quit to exit.

### Delete Task

Remove a task from the list:

```bash
jps-effort-tracker delete-task
```

Select the task number you want to delete.

### Version

Show version information:

```bash
jps-effort-tracker version
```

## Task Properties

Each task includes:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `task_id` | string | Auto-generated timestamp ID (YYYY.MM.DD.HH.MM.SS) |
| `title` | string | Short task title |
| `description` | string | Detailed task description |
| `priority` | int | Priority level (1-5) |
| `due_date` | datetime | When the task is due |
| `date_created` | datetime | When the task was created |
| `status` | string | Current status (pending, in-progress, completed, etc.) |
| `completed` | bool | Whether the task is completed |
| `issue_tracker_id` | string | External issue tracker reference |
| `issue_type` | string | Type of work (enhancement, bugfix, etc.) |
| `effort_estimate` | int | Estimated duration in minutes |
| `level_of_effort` | string | Complexity category (Easy, Medium, Hard, Complex) |

## Configuration

Default configuration is stored at `src/jps_effort_tracker_utils/conf/config.yaml`. You can provide a custom configuration:

```yaml
tasks_dir: /path/to/your/tasks
```

By default, tasks are stored in: `~/effort-tracker-utils/tasks/`

Each day gets its own YAML file: `YYYY-MM-DD.yaml`

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jai-python3/effort-tracker-utils.git
cd effort-tracker-utils
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Code Quality Tools
