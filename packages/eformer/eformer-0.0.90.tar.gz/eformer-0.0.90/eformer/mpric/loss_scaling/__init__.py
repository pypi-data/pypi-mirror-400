"""Loss scaling submodule for mixed precision training stability.

This submodule provides loss scaling utilities that help maintain numerical
stability during mixed precision training. Loss scaling is essential when
using low-precision dtypes (float16) to prevent gradient underflow.

Classes:
    DynamicLossScale: Automatically adjusts scale based on gradient health.
    NoOpLossScale: No-op scaler for when loss scaling is not needed.
    LossScaleConfig: Configuration for loss scaling hyperparameters.
