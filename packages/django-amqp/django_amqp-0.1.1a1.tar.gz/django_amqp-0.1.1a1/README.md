# Django AMQP

AMQP support for Django, with implementations for RabbitMQ and Azure ServiceBus.

## Overview

Django AMQP is an extension for Django that provides Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
(AMQP) support. It enables you to easily implement message queues and task processing
in your Django applications using either RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus as the backend.

The library integrates with Django's task framework, allowing you to define, queue, and
process asynchronous tasks with support for scheduled/deferred execution.

## Installation

```bash
pip install django-amqp
```

OR

```bash
uv add django-amqp
```

## Configuration

Add `django_amqp` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'django_amqp',
    # ...
]
```

Configure your task backend in `settings.py`:

```python
SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STRING = os.environ.get("SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STRING")

TASKS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django_amqp.backend.ServiceBusBackend",
        "QUEUES": [
            "default",
        ],
        "OPTIONS": {"connection_string": SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STRING},
    }
}

```

## Usage

### Defining Tasks

Create a task using Django's task decorator:

```python
from django.tasks import task

@task(queue_name="my-queue")
def my_background_task(param1, param2, **kwargs):
    # Your task logic here
    pass
```

> **_NOTE:_** `queue_name` defaults to `"default"` (as per django tasks implementation).
> You may want to name your main worker ServiceBus/RabbitMQ queue as `"default"` to
> match this. Otherwise, specify`queue_name` for each task.\*

### Queueing Tasks

#### Queue a Task for Immediate Execution

```python
from myapp.tasks import my_background_task

# Queue for immediate execution
my_background_task.enqueue(param1="value1", param2="value2")
```

you can also batch queue

```python
from myapp.tasks import my_background_task

# Batch Queue for immediate execution
my_background_task.get_backend().batch_enqueue(
    my_background_task, [
            ([], {param1="value1", param2="value2"}),
            ([], {param1="value3", param2="value4"})
        ]
)
# It's more performant to queue many messages at once, instead of making a connection
# for each
```

#### Queue and Cancel a Task for Delayed Execution

You can cancel scheduled messages using the sequence number returned when scheduling a
message:

```python
from django_amqp.service_bus import cancel_deferred_message

# Schedule a task and get the sequence number
sequence_number = my_background_task.delay_until(future_time, param1="value1")

# Later, if you need to cancel it
cancel_deferred_message(sequence_number, queue_name="my-queue")
```

### Running Workers

To process messages from a specific queue:

```bash
python manage.py amqp_worker --queue-name="my-queue" --burst
```

The `--burst` flag tells the worker to process all available messages and then exit.

### Error Handling

When using the ServiceBus Backend, failed tasks are automatically moved to the
dead-letter queue with the error reason and description. You can implement additional
error handling in your task functions.
