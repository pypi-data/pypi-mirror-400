    Attempts to determine the local IP address of the machine.

    This function creates a temporary socket and connects to a public-facing
    IP address to determine the primary local IP address of the host machine.
    This is useful for displaying a network-accessible URL for the server.

    If the IP address cannot be determined (e.g., no network connection),
    it defaults to '127.0.0.1'.

    Returns:
        str: The local IP address as a string.
