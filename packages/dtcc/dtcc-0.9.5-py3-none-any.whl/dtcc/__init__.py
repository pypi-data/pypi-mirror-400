"""
Static imports for type checkers and IntelliSense.

These imports are wrapped in `if TYPE_CHECKING`, which is always `False` at
runtime. This means:
  - The imports below **never execute** when the package is imported normally,
    so they have **zero runtime cost** and do not introduce additional
    dependencies.
  - Static analyzers such as Pylance, Pyright, and mypy **do** evaluate them
    to understand which symbols are re-exported at the top level of the
    `dtcc` package.

In short: this block exists purely to give IDEs full autocomplete and
documentation for `dtcc.<symbol>` while keeping the runtime import logic
dynamic and lightweight.
