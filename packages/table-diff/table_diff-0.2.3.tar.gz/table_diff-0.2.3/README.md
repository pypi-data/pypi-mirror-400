# Table Diff

Table Diff is a Python package that provides a text-based interface for comparing two tables. It is designed to be used by data analysts and data scientists to compare two tables and identify differences between them, especially as transformation rules are adjusted in an ETL pipeline.

The diff between two tables is printed to stdout as Markdown, and can be saved to a Markdown, HTML, or DuckDB file.

## Features

* Generate a diff report between two tables.
* View the diff quickly in Markdown.
* Supports the following input formats:
    * CSV
    * Parquet
* Supports the following output formats:
    * HTML (summary)
    * DuckDB (comprehensive)
    * Markdown (summary)
    * PDF (summary - experimental)
* View common enum/value transitions.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.10 or later, and the `uv` Python package manager.
