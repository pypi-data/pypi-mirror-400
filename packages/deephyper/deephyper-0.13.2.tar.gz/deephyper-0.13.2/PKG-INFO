# DeepHyper: A Python Package for Massively Parallel Hyperparameter Optimization in Machine Learning

DeepHyper is first and foremost a hyperparameter optimization (HPO) library. By leveraging this core HPO functionnality, DeepHyper also provides neural architecture search, multi-fidelity and ensemble capabilities. With DeepHyper, users can easily perform these tasks on a single machine or distributed across multiple machines, making it ideal for use in a variety of environments. Whether you’re a beginner looking to optimize your machine learning models or an experienced data scientist looking to streamline your workflow, DeepHyper has something to offer. So why wait? Start using DeepHyper today and take your machine learning skills to the next level!

## Installation

Installation with `pip`:

```console
pip install deephyper
```

More details about the installation process can be found in our [Installation](https://deephyper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/) documentation.

## Quickstart

The black-box function named `run` is defined by taking an input job named `job` which contains the different variables to optimize `job.parameters`. Then the run-function is bound to an `Evaluator` in charge of distributing the computation of multiple evaluations. Finally, a Bayesian search named `CBO` is created and executed to find the values of config which **MAXIMIZE** the return value of `run(job)`.

```python
from deephyper.evaluator import Evaluator
from deephyper.hpo import HpProblem, CBO


def run(job):
    # The suggested parameters are accessible in job.parameters (dict)
    x = job.parameters["x"]
    b = job.parameters["b"]

    if job.parameters["function"] == "linear":
        y = x + b
    elif job.parameters["function"] == "cubic":
        y = x**3 + b

    # Maximization!
    return y


def test_quickstart(tmp_path):


    # define the variable you want to optimize
    problem = HpProblem()
    problem.add_hyperparameter((-10.0, 10.0), "x")  # real parameter
    problem.add_hyperparameter((0, 10), "b")  # discrete parameter
    problem.add_hyperparameter(["linear", "cubic"], "function")  # categorical parameter

    # define the evaluator to distribute the computation
    evaluator = Evaluator.create(
        run,
        method="process",
        method_kwargs={
            "num_workers": 2,
        },
    )

    # define your search and execute it
    search = CBO(problem, log_dir=tmp_path, random_state=42)

    results = search.search(evaluator, max_evals=100)
    print(results)

    assert abs(results.objective.max()) > 1000
    assert "p:x" in results.columns
    assert "p:b" in results.columns
    assert "p:function" in results.columns
    assert len(results) >= 100


if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_quickstart(".")

```

Which outputs the following results where the best parameters are with `function == "cubic"`, 
`x == 9.99` and `b == 10`.
