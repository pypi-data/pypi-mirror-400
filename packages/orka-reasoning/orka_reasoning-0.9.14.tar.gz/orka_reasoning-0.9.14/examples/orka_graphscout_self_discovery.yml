      QUESTION: {{ get_input() }}
      INITIAL ANALYSIS: {{ get_agent_response('initial_question_analysis') }}
      
      Available analysis agents:
      - architectural_deep_dive: Examines system architecture and design
      - behavioral_observer: Studies execution patterns and behaviors
      - cognitive_examiner: Analyzes reasoning and intelligence
      - emergence_detector: Looks for emergent properties and complexity
      
      Based on the question and initial analysis, select the SINGLE most appropriate agent for this investigation.
      
      SELECTED_AGENT: [choose exactly one: architectural_deep_dive, behavioral_observer, cognitive_examiner, or emergence_detector]
      REASONING: [why this agent is the best choice]
