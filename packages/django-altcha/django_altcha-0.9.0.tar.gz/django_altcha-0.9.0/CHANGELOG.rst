- Add a ``ALTCHA_VERIFICATION_ENABLED`` setting, default to ``True``.
  This setting, when set to ``False``, allows to skip Altcha validation altogether.

v0.2.0 (2025-06-17)
-------------------

Special thanks to Alex Vandiver alexmv@zulip.com for reporting these issues.

**Important Security Note:**
If you have previously set and used a static ``ALTCHA_HMAC_KEY``,
you **must rotate this key** as part of upgrading to this release.

Earlier versions of ``django-altcha`` accepted challenges that were generated without
an expiration (``expires``) value.
This allowed older challenges to remain valid indefinitely.
As a result, any attacker with access to an old challenge could reuse it to bypass
CAPTCHA validation.

To fully benefit from the security improvements in this release,
you must also **invalidate any existing challenges** by rotating the HMAC key used
to generate and verify them.

- Add a AltchaChallengeView to allow  `challengeurl` a setup.
  This view returns a challenge as JSON to be fetched by the Altcha JS widget.
  https://github.com/aboutcode-org/django-altcha/pull/9

- Add challenge expiration support.
  Default to 20 minutes as per Altcha security recommendations.
  Can be customized through the `ALTCHA_CHALLENGE_EXPIRE` setting.

  https://github.com/aboutcode-org/django-altcha/pull/7

- Add protection against replay attacks.
  Verified challenges are now marked as used and cannot be reused,
  helping to prevent repeated or spoofed submissions.

v0.1.3 (2025-04-15)
-------------------

- Use the value from the AltchaField `maxnumber` option, when provided, to generate the
