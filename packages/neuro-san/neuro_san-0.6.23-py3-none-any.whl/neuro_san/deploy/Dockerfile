# This Dockerfile is expected to be run from the top-level of neuro-san.

# If you find yourself wanting to modify this file
# and check it into the neuro-san repo or modify it in place with the
# neuro-san source code, chances are you shouldn't. Instead, strongly
# consider creating your own repo with your own agents and using this
# Dockerfile and accompanying scripts as a basis to riff on for your
# own projects.  Your own requirements.txt file for your project will
# need to include neuro-san as a dependency.
#
# Use ./neuro_san/deploy/build.sh to build this container from within the
# neuro-san repo. After a successful build of the container, you can use
# ./neuro_san/deploy/run.sh to run the built container locally.
#
# To find server-oriented environment variables to help you configure things
# how you want, search for "ENV AGENT_" in this file.

# Sometimes it is useful to report a library version explicitly when they are not actually
# pip-installed (for instance when building a container from your own source, it's the

# Forks multiple worker processes, each with its own Tornado event loop, all sharing the same listening socket.
# Impact:
# Allows utilization of multiple CPU cores.

# start(0) → Automatically spawns one process per CPU core.
# start(N) → Manually specifies number of worker processes.

# open file descriptors;
# open connections for server port.
# Logging period is specified in seconds.
ENV AGENT_HTTP_RESOURCES_MONITOR_INTERVAL=0

# If this value is specified and >0,
# it will enable dynamic temporary network updates of the server agents
# allowing CodedTools to reserve temporary networks via the Reservationist
# interface, if the agent network hocon file specifically allows it for the tool.

# External to the server, so other replicated pods can pick them up.
# This class must have a no-args constructor and implement the

# When not set, this defaults to a null implementation.
# A simple default implementation is provided by the class
# "neuro_san.service.watcher.temp_networks.s3_reservations_storage.S3ReservationsStorage"
ENV AGENT_EXTERNAL_RESERVATIONS_STORAGE=""

# When the AGENT_EXTERNAL_RESERVATIONS_STORAGE (immediately above) is set to the

# to use for cross-pod reservations storage.
ENV AGENT_RESERVATIONS_S3_BUCKET=""
