AI Agent Payment Processing SDK - Non-custodial USDC payments for AI agents with bundled intelligence services.


## Features

- **Non-custodial**: Your wallet, your keys. We never custody funds.
- **Low fees**: 1.5% + $0.01 per transaction ($0.05 minimum)
- **Multi-chain**: Base Chain primary, with Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum support
- **Intelligence bundle**: 41 x402 microservices for market data, analytics, and more
- **CDP wallets**: Automatic wallet creation via Coinbase Developer Platform
- **Type-safe**: Full Pydantic models for all API responses

## Installation

```bash
pip install coinrailz
```

## Get Your API Key

**Instant API Key** - Pay $1 (USDC/USDT on Base or Solana) and get your API key immediately. No account required!

1. Visit https://coinrailz.com/api-keys
2. Send $1 to the platform wallet
3. Verify your transaction and receive your key + $5 starter credits

**Key Persistence**: Your API key is permanent and works across ALL services. One key = unlimited access (credits are deducted per use). You can top up credits anytime with the same key.

## Quick Start

```python
from coinrailz import CoinRailz

# Initialize the client
client = CoinRailz(api_key="cr_live_...")  # Get your API key at https://coinrailz.com/api-keys

# Send a payment (1.5% + $0.01 fee)
result = client.send(
    to="0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
    amount=100,
    memo="Service payment"
)

if result.success:
    print(f"Payment sent: {result.transaction_id}")
    print(f"Fee: ${result.fee}")
    print(f"Net amount: ${result.net_amount}")
```

## API Reference

### Initialization

```python
from coinrailz import CoinRailz

    timeout=30,  # Optional, request timeout in seconds
    enable_intelligence=False  # Optional, enable x402 intelligence services
)
```

### Send Payment

Send USDC to an address. Fee: 1.5% + $0.01

```python
result = client.send(
    to="0x...",  # Recipient address
    amount=100,  # Amount in USDC
    currency="USDC",  # Optional, default USDC
    memo="Payment for services",  # Optional
    metadata={"order_id": "123"}  # Optional, custom data
)

# Response (SendPaymentResult)
# result.success = True
# result.transaction_id = "sdk_tx_..."
# result.status = "pending"
# result.amount = 100
# result.fee = 1.51
# result.net_amount = 98.49
# result.fee_breakdown.rate = "1.5% + $0.01"
```

### Create Invoice

Create a payment invoice for receiving funds.

```python
invoice = client.create_invoice(
    amount=50,
    description="AI assistant service fee",
    expires_in=15  # Minutes, default 15
)

# Response (InvoiceResult)
# invoice.invoice_id = "sdk_inv_..."
# invoice.payment_address = "0x..."
# invoice.status = "pending"
```

### Get Reports

```python
report = client.get_reports(
    period="weekly",  # "daily" | "weekly" | "monthly"
    format="json"  # "json" | "markdown"

# Response (ReportResult)
# report.summary.total_transactions = 42
# report.summary.total_volume_usd = 5280.50
```

# Response (BalanceResult)
# balance.balances.USDC = 1250.00

```python
client = CoinRailz(
    api_key="cr_live_...",
    enable_intelligence=True
)

# Get wallet risk score
risk = client.intelligence("wallet-risk", {"address": "0x..."})

# Get trade signals
signals = client.intelligence("trade-signals", {"token": "ETH"})

# Get token sentiment
sentiment = client.intelligence("token-sentiment", {"token": "BTC"})

from coinrailz import CoinRailz, ApiError

result = client.send(to="0x...", amount=100)

if isinstance(result, ApiError):
    print(f"Error: {result.error}")
    print(f"Message: {result.message}")

    # Handle specific errors
    if result.error == "INVALID_API_KEY":
        # Regenerate API key
        pass
    elif result.error == "RATE_LIMITED":
        # Wait and retry
        pass
```
