G.

The lack of depth in the absorption lines seems to be more\npronounced among the smaller and fainter nebulae, and in N. G.

Explanations of this paradox have been\nsought in a correlation between apparent radial velocities and distances,\nbut so far the results have not been convincing. The present paper is a\nre-examination of the question, based on only those nebular distances\nwhich are believed to be fairly reliable.\n\nDistances of extra-galactic nebulae depend ultimately upon the appli-\ncation of absolute-luminosity criteria to involved stars whose types can\nbe recognized. These include, among others, Cepheid variables, novae,\nand blue stars involved in emission nebulosity. Numerical values depend\nupon the zero point of the period-luminosity relation among Cepheids,\nthe other criteria merely check the order of the distances. This method\nis restricted to the few nebulae which are well resolved by existing instru-\nments. A study of these nebulae, together with those in which any stars\nat all can be recognized, indicates the probability of an approximately\nuniform upper limit to the absolute luminosity of stars, in the late-type\nspirals and irregular nebulae at least, of the order of $M$ (photographic) =\n-6.3.1 The apparent luminosities of the brightest stars in such nebulae\nare thus criteria which, although rough and to be applied with caution,\n\n<!--page-->\nVOL. 15, 1929 ASTRONOMY: E.

The data are given in table 1. The first seven\ndistances are the most reliable, depending, except for M 32 the companion of\nM 31, upon extensive investigations of many stars involved. The next\nthirteen distances, depending upon the criterion of a uniform upper limit\nof stellar luminosity, are subject to considerable probable errors but are\nbelieved to be the most reasonable values at present available. The last\nfour objects appear to be in the Virgo Cluster. The distance assigned\nto the cluster, $2 \\times 10^6$ parsecs, is derived from the distribution of nebular\nluminosities, together with luminosities of stars in some of the later-type\nspirals, and differs somewhat from the Harvard estimate of ten million\nlight years.2\n\nThe data in the table indicate a linear correlation between distances and\nvelocities, whether the latter are used directly or corrected for solar motion,\naccording to the older solutions. This suggests a new solution for the solar\nmotion in which the distances are introduced as coefficients of the $K$ term,\ni. e., the velocities are assumed to vary directly with the distances, and\nhence $K$ represents the velocity at unit distance due to this effect. The\nequations of condition then take the form\n\n$$ rK + X \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\delta + Y \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\delta + Z \\sin \\delta = v. $$\n\nTwo solutions have been made, one using the 24 nebulae individually,\nthe other combining them into 9 groups according to proximity in direc-\ntion and in distance. The results are\n\n24 OBJECTS\n$X$ = -65 $\\pm$ 50\n$Y$ = +226 $\\pm$ 95\n$Z$ = -195 $\\pm$ 40\n$K$ = +465 $\\pm$ 50\n$A$ = $286^{\\circ}$\n$D$ = $+40^{\\circ}$\n$V_o$ = 306 km./sec.\n\n9 GROUPS\n+3 $\\pm$ 70\n+230 $\\pm$ 120\n-133 $\\pm$ 70\n+513 $\\pm$ 60 km./sec. per $10^6$ parsecs.\n$269^{\\circ}$\n$+33^{\\circ}$\n247 km./sec.\n\nFor such scanty material, so poorly distributed, the results are fairly\ndefinite. Differences between the two solutions are due largely to the\nfour Virgo nebulae, which, being the most distant objects and all sharing\nthe peculiar motion of the cluster, unduly influence the value of $K$ and\nhence of $V_o$. New data on more distant objects will be required to reduce\nthe effect of such peculiar motion. Meanwhile round numbers, inter-\nmediate between the two solutions, will represent the probable order of\nthe values. For instance, let $A = 277^{\\circ}$, $D = +36^{\\circ}$ (Gal. long. = $32^{\\circ}$,\nlat. = $+18^{\\circ}$), $V_o = 280$ km./sec., $K = +500$ km./sec. per million par-\n\n<!--page-->\nVOL. 15, 1929 ASTRONOMY: E.

Mr. Str\u00f6mberg has very kindly checked the general order of these\nvalues by independent solutions for different groupings of the data.\n\nA constant term, introduced into the equations, was found to be small\nand negative. This seems to dispose of the necessity for the old constant\n$K$ term. Solutions of this sort have been published by Lundmark,3 who\nreplaced the old $K$ by $k + lr + mr^2$. His favored solution gave $k = 513$,\nas against the former value of the order of 700, and hence offered little\nadvantage.\n\n<!--table-->\nTABLE 2\nNEBULAE WHOSE DISTANCES ARE ESTIMATED FROM RADIAL VELOCITIES\n\n| OBJECT       | $v_c$   | $v_o$    | $r$   | $m_v$ | $M_v$    |\n| :----------- | :------ | :------- | :---- | :---- | :------- |\n| N.

The run of the re-\nsiduals is about as smooth as can be expected, and in general the form of\nthe solutions appears to be adequate.\n\nThe 22 nebulae for which distances are not available can be treated in\ntwo ways.

Distances can then be calculated from the velocities cor-\nrected for solar motion, and absolute magnitudes can be derived from the\napparent magnitudes.

The object\nis not necessarily an exception, however, since a distance can be assigned\nfor which the peculiar motion and the absolute magnitude are both within\nthe range previously determined. The two mean magnitudes, -15.3\nand -15.5, the ranges, 4.9 and 5.0 mag., and the frequency distributions\nare closely similar for these two entirely independent sets of data; and\neven the slight difference in mean magnitudes can be attributed to the\nselected, very bright, nebulae in the Virgo Cluster. This entirely unforced\nagreement supports the validity of the velocity-distance relation in a very\n\n<!--page-->\nVOL. 15, 1929 ASTRONOMY: E. HUBBLE 173\n\nevident matter. Finally, it is worth recording that the frequency distribu-\ntion of absolute magnitudes in the two tables combined is comparable\nwith those found in the various clusters of nebulae.4\n\nThe results establish a roughly linear relation between velocities and\ndistances among nebulae for which velocities have been previously pub-\nlished, and the relation appears to dominate the distribution of velocities.\nIn order to investigate the matter on a much larger scale, Mr. Humason\nat Mount Wilson has initiated a program of determining velocities\nof the most distant nebulae that can be observed with confidence.\nThese, naturally, are the brightest nebulae in clusters of nebulae.\nThe first definite result, $v = + 3779$ km./sec. for N. G. C. 7619, is\nthoroughly consistent with the present conclusions. Corrected for the\nsolar motion, this velocity is +3910, which, with $K = 500$, corresponds to\na distance of $7.8 \\times 10^6$ parsecs. Since the apparent magnitude is 11.8,\nthe absolute magnitude at such a distance is -17.65, which is of the\nright order for the brightest nebulae in a cluster. A preliminary dis-\ntance, derived independently from the cluster of which this nebula appears\nto be a member, is of the order of $7 \\times 10^6$ parsecs.\n\nNew data to be expected in the near future may modify the significance\nof the present investigation or, if confirmatory, will lead to a solution\nhaving many times the weight. For this reason it is thought premature\nto discuss in detail the obvious consequences of the present results. For\nexample, if the solar motion with respect to the clusters represents the\nrotation of the galactic system, this motion could be subtracted from the\nresults for the nebulae and the remainder would represent the motion of\nthe galactic system with respect to the extra-galactic nebulae.\n\nThe outstanding feature, however, is the possibility that the velocity-\ndistance relation may represent the de Sitter effect, and hence that numer-\nical data may be introduced into discussions of the general curvature of\nspace. In the de Sitter cosmology, displacements of the spectra arise\nfrom two sources, an apparent slowing down of atomic vibrations and a\ngeneral tendency of material particles to scatter. The latter involves an\nacceleration and hence introduces the element of time. The relative im-\nportance of these two effects should determine the form of the relation\nbetween distances and observed velocities; and in this connection it may\nbe emphasized that the linear relation found in the present discussion is a\nfirst approximation representing a restricted range in distance.\n\n1.  *Mt.
