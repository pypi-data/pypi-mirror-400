# MANIFEST.in - controls what goes into source distributions (sdist)
#
# For production releases, we distribute compiled wheels (.whl) which
# contain only the compiled .so/.pyd binaries, not the source .py files.
#
# This MANIFEST.in is for source distributions (sdist) which are typically
# only used for development or when wheels aren't available for a platform.
