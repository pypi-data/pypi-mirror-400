## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- **Celery Beat Schedule Issue**: Fixed critical issue where Celery Beat was creating malformed database filenames due to environment variable conflicts
- **Task Configuration**: Removed `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` from environment variables to prevent conflicts with code-based configuration
- **Database Backup Task**: Fixed task reference path from `'backup_database_task'` to `'app.tasks.backup_database_task.backup_database_task'`
