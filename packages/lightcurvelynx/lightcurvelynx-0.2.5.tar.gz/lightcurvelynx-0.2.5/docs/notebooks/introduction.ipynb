    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "LightCurveLynx is a package for large-scale, time-domain forward-modeling of astronomical light curve data. Simulations incorporate realistic effects, including survey cadence, dust extinction, and instrument noise models. LightCurveLynx is designed to enable user extensibility, such as adding new models, effects, and instruments, while ensuring scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we discuss the overall flow of LightCurveLynx and how to use it to run simulations. The goal is to get a new user started and allow them to explore the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later tutorials cover topics in more depth, including:\n",
    "  - Sampling Parameters (sampling.ipynb) - Provides an introduction to parameters and how they are sampled within a simulation run.\n",
    "  - Adding new model types (adding_models.ipynb) - Provides a more in-depth discussion of ``BasePhysicalModel``, ``BandfluxModel``, and ``SEDModel`` subclasses and how to add new models.\n",
    "  - Add new effect types (addings_effects.ipynb) - Provides a discussion of the ``EffectModel`` class, how it is used, and how to create new subclasses.\n",
    "  - Working directly with passbands (passband-demo.ipynb)\n",
    "  - Working directly with ObsTables / Rubin OpSims (opsim_notebook.ipynb)\n",

    "## Program Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "LightCurveLynx generates synthetic light curves using the stages shown in the illustration below. A `BasePhysicalModel` and information about the parameter distributions is used to sample the models. These are combined with information from an `ObsTable`, such as a Rubin `OpSim`, to generate sample flux densities at a given set of times and wavelengths (or passbands), accounting for effects such as redshift. The simulator also applies other relevant effects to the rest frame flux densities (e.g. dust extinction) and the observer frame flux densities (detector noise). At the end the code outputs a series of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The simulation flow](../_static/lightcurvelynx-intro.png \"The simulation flow\")\n",
    "\n",
    "A user has several important questions to answer when doing a new simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What do you want to simulate (supernova, kilanova, AGN, etc.)? The answer to this question determines the subclass of ``BasePhysicalModel`` you will use to create the model object. For example, if you want to simulate a kilanova using the ``redback`` package, you would start by creating ``RedbackWrapperModel`` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What parameters does your model have? And how do you want to set them? The answers to these questions determine how you set the parameters of the model object. All parameters within a model are set using arguments in the object’s constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What effects do you want to apply to the light coming from this object? The answer to this question will determine which effect objects you create and add to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Under what conditions do you want to observe this object? What is your viewing cadence and instrument noise characteristics? In short, which survey (``ObsTable`` and ``PassbandGroup``) are you using? Most users will just need to choose from one of the predefined survey options, such as LSST or ZTF.\n"

    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "All light curves are generated from model objects that are a subclass of the `BasePhysicalModel` class. These model objects provide mechanisms for:\n",
    "  - Sampling their parameters from given distributions,\n",
    "  - Generating flux densities at given times and wavelengths (or passbands), and\n",
    "  - Applying noise and other effects to the observations.\n",
    "All of these steps are performed behind the scenes, so a user only needs to know what type of object they are simulating and select the corresponding class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major goal of LightCurveLynx is to be easily extensible so that users can create and analyze their own models. See the `adding_models.ipynb` notebook for examples of how to add a new type of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Each \"sample\" of the data corresponds to a new simulated object. This object consists of a new sampling of the model's parameters and a generation of flux densities from those parameters. Thus, when a user generates a hundred samples, they are generating 100 light curves from 100 sample objects. For a detailed description of how sampling works, see the `sampling.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can demonstrate this simulation flow using `SinWaveModel`, a toy model that generates fluxes using a sin wave. The `SinWaveModel` object uses multiple parameters to generate its flux, so we need to specify how to set these. For some parameters we may have a fixed value, such as a brightness of 100.0. But in most simulations we will want the values of the parameters themselves to vary. We can set these from other nodes (any object that generates or uses parameters). Below we set two of the model's parameters (`frequency` and `t0`) from uniform distributions and two (`RA` and `dec`) are chosen from a Gaussian that matches the toy survey information we will load later in this notebook."
