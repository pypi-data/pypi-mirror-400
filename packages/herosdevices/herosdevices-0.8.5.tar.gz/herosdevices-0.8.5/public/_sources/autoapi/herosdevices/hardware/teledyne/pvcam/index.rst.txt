.. py:class:: PvcamCamera(cam_id: str, config_dict: dict, default_config: str | None = None, lib_path: str | None = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`herosdevices.core.templates.camera.CameraTemplate`


   A class to interface with Teledyne PVCam Cameras.

   The class provides functionality to control and capture images from cameras.
   It manages camera configuration, acquisition, and data streaming compatible with the atomiq camera template.

   :param cam_id: Serial number of the cam. Can be obtained for example from the ids-peak GUI. Note, that the id
                  is only the first part of the value shown in the GUI, the part including the device type is not
                  unique and may not be added to :code:`cam_id`.
   :param lib_path: Path to vendor library.
   :param config_dict: Dict of configuration values like shown in the json example above.
   :param default_config: Default key in :code:`config_dict` to use.

   .. note::

      The vendor library must be obtained from the
      `official website <https://www.teledynevisionsolutions.com/products/pvcam-sdk-amp-driver/>`_
      Make sure that after the installation either the environment variable :code:`PVCAM_SDK_PATH` is set to the
      correct path or pass it via the :code:`lib_path` argument.

   .. note::

      Other than the special config keys listed below, the keys are property names of the pyvcam
      :code:`Camera` object. You can find the full list of available properties sometimes in the pyvcam documentation
      or by crawling `this file <https://github.com/Photometrics/PyVCAM/blob/master/src/pyvcam/camera.py>`_.
      
      **Special Config Keys:**
      
      - ``exposure_time``: exposure time in seconds. Automatically sets the nearest resolution (`exp_res` camera
        parameter). If you want to set the `exp_res` attribute manually, use the camera key `exp_time`
        (in the corresponding units) instead of `exposure_time`.
      - ``trigger_delay``: Is added to the trigger delay that can be obtained by :py:attr:`PvcamCamera.trigger_delay`
        and can be used for a cable and camera dependent delay.
      - ``frame_count``: number of frame buffers to set up, `-1` means infinite number of frames. Note, that this is
        currently not supported though. If you need it implemented via a circular buffer, please open an issue or get
        in contact with us.
      - ``post_processing``: A dict of post processing parameters (only if camera supports it), of the form
        :code:`{'feature_name': ['param_name', 'param_value']}`. See the documentation of the camera for details.

      This is for example useful to get possible
      configuration options for the camera. Possible properties can be found in the source code of the
      `pyvcam driver <https://github.com/Photometrics/PyVCAM/blob/master/src/pyvcam/camera.py>`_.

                       :code:`payload_metadata` attribute (for example set by the :code:`update_payload_metadata` method)
                       while merging the two dicts.

   This class adds the following device specific functionality:

   - The trigger delay stored in the :py:attr:`Kinetix.trigger_delay` is calculated from the user specified trigger
     delay and the delay from the trigger input to the `All Rows` condition.

   For more information refer to :py:class:`PvcamCamera`

      It is well possible to that other PVCam cameras that support the fake global shutter concept (e.g. defined
      `All Rows` condition) can also be used with this driver.
