# CHAOSS Metrics Alignment Validation Report

**Date:** December 10, 2025
**Purpose:** Validate OSS Sustain Guard metrics against official CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software) metrics and models

## Executive Summary

✅ **Overall Alignment: STRONG**

OSS Sustain Guard implements 12 metrics that align well with CHAOSS standards. All metrics follow CHAOSS principles of measuring community health through observable, data-driven indicators.

## CHAOSS Framework Overview

CHAOSS organizes metrics into:

- **Individual Metrics**: Answer single questions about community health
- **Metrics Models**: Collections of metrics providing deeper context
- **Focus Areas**: Common themes (Contributor, Lifecycle, Platform, etc.)

## Detailed Metric Mapping

### ✅ Directly Aligned Metrics (9/12)

| OSS Sustain Guard Metric | CHAOSS Metric | Alignment Status |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| **Contributor Redundancy** | [Elephant Factor](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-elephant-factor/) | ✅ **Perfect** - Measures contributor concentration |
| **Maintainer Retention** | [Inactive Contributors](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-inactive-contributors/) | ✅ **Strong** - Tracks maintainer activity over time |
| **Recent Activity** | [Activity Dates and Times](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-activity-dates-and-times/) | ✅ **Perfect** - Measures project activity recency |
| **Change Request Resolution** | [Change Request Review Duration](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-change-request-review-duration/) / [Change Requests Duration](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-change-requests-duration/) | ✅ **Perfect** - Measures PR/CR merge time |
| **Release Rhythm** | [Release Frequency](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-release-frequency/) | ✅ **Perfect** - Tracks release cadence |
| **Community Health** | [Issue Response Time](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-issue-response-time/) / [Time to First Response](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-time-to-first-response/) | ✅ **Perfect** - Measures issue response latency |
| **Contributor Attraction** | [New Contributors](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-new-contributors/) | ✅ **Perfect** - Tracks new contributor onboarding |
| **Contributor Retention** | [Inactive Contributors](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-inactive-contributors/) (inverse) | ✅ **Strong** - Measures contributor staying power |
| **Review Health** | [Review Cycle Duration within a Change Request](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-review-cycle-duration-within-a-change-request/) / [Change Request Reviews](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-change-request-reviews/) | ✅ **Perfect** - Measures PR review quality |

### ⚠️  Partially Aligned Metrics (2/12)

| OSS Sustain Guard Metric | CHAOSS Equivalent | Gap Analysis |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Build Health** | [Test Coverage](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-test-coverage/) (partial) | ⚠️ **Partial** - CHAOSS focuses on test coverage; we measure CI status. Both are valid quality signals. |
| **Security Signals** | [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Badge](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-open-source-security-foundation-openssf-best-practices-badge/) | ⚠️ **Partial** - CHAOSS uses OpenSSF badges; we check security policies and alerts. Complementary approaches. |

### 🆕 OSS Sustain Guard Specific (1/12)

| OSS Sustain Guard Metric | Notes |
| ------------------------ | ----- |
| **Funding Signals** | 🆕 **Original** - CHAOSS has [Sponsorship](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-sponsorship/) but focuses on event sponsorship. Our metric specifically tracks GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, etc. for project sustainability. This is a valuable addition to the CHAOSS ecosystem. |

## Metrics Models Alignment

### Stability Model

**OSS Sustain Guard Components:**

- Community Health (13%)
- Security Signals (13%)

**CHAOSS Alignment:** ✅ **Strong**

- Maps to CHAOSS stability focus area
- Uses "Elephant Factor" (contributor concentration signal)
- Incorporates "Contributor Absence Factor" concepts
- **Recommendation:** Consider renaming to "Project Stability Model" to match CHAOSS terminology

### Sustainability Model

**OSS Sustain Guard Components:**

- Funding Signals (33%)
- Maintainer Retention (33%)
- Release Rhythm (33%)

**CHAOSS Alignment:** ✅ **Strong**

- Addresses long-term project viability
- Aligns with CHAOSS [Project Burnout](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-project-burnout/) concerns
- Includes financial sustainability (unique to OSS Sustain Guard)
- **Recommendation:** This model fills a gap in CHAOSS - financial sustainability is underrepresented

### Community Engagement Model

**OSS Sustain Guard Components:**

- Contributor Attraction (30%)
- Contributor Retention (30%)
- Review Health (25%)
- Community Health (15%)

**CHAOSS Alignment:** ✅ **Perfect**

- Direct mapping to CHAOSS "Community" focus area
- Uses "New Contributors" and retention metrics
- Measures "Newcomer Experience" through response times
- **Recommendation:** This model exemplifies CHAOSS best practices

## CHAOSS Metrics We Could Add

Based on CHAOSS standards, these metrics would enhance our coverage:

### High Priority

1. **[Contributor Absence Factor](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-contributor-absence-factor/)** (Bus Factor equivalent) - We already implement this as "Contributor Redundancy"! ✅
2. **[Libyears](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-libyears/)** - Dependency freshness (already planned in Phase 4)
3. **[Contributors](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-contributors/)** - Total contributor count (we calculate this but don't surface as metric)

### Medium Priority

1. **[Change Request Acceptance Ratio](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-change-request-acceptance-ratio/)** - PR acceptance rate
2. **[Burstiness](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-burstiness/)** - Activity pattern regularity
3. **[Project Velocity](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-project-velocity/)** - Overall development pace

### Low Priority (Data-Intensive)

1. **[Organizational Diversity](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-organizational-diversity/)** - Company diversity in contributors
2. **[Types of Contributions](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-types-of-contributions/)** - Code vs. docs vs. issues

## Naming Validation

### ✅ Excellent CHAOSS-Aligned Names (Phase 1-4 Renames)

| Original Name | Current Name | CHAOSS Alignment |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Bus Factor | **Contributor Redundancy** | ✅ More professional than "Elephant Factor" |
| Maintainer Drain | **Maintainer Retention** | ✅ Positive framing, CHAOSS-compatible |
| Zombie Check | **Recent Activity** | ✅ Neutral, observation-focused |
| Merge Velocity | **Change Request Resolution** | ✅ Matches CHAOSS "Change Request" terminology |
| CI Status | **Build Health** | ✅ Broader scope than just CI |
| Funding | **Funding Signals** | ✅ Supportive, signal-based language |
| Release Cadence | **Release Rhythm** | ✅ Friendly alternative to "Frequency" |
| Security Posture | **Security Signals** | ✅ Non-judgmental, observation-focused |
| Issue Responsiveness | **Community Health** | ✅ Broader framing for issue response time |

**Verdict:** All renamed metrics align with CHAOSS principles of:

- Observation over judgment
- Health-focused language
- Measurable, data-driven indicators

## Scoring Methodology Alignment

### OSS Sustain Guard Approach

- Weighted scoring (0-100 scale)
- Status levels: None, Low, Medium, High, Needs support
- Supportive messaging ("Needs attention" vs. "Needs support outcome")

### CHAOSS Approach

- CHAOSS does not prescribe scoring - focuses on **measurement**
- Metrics answer questions; interpretation is context-dependent
- No universal "good" or "bad" thresholds

**Alignment Analysis:** ⚠️ **Philosophical Difference**

- CHAOSS: "Here's the data, you decide what it means"
- OSS Sustain Guard: "Here's the data + our interpretation for sustainability concerns"

**Recommendation:**

- ✅ Keep our scoring - it provides actionable insights
- ✅ Add `--raw` flag to show CHAOSS-style uninterpreted metrics
- ✅ Document our scoring methodology as "OSS Sustain Guard Scoring Framework"

## Display Format Alignment

### Current Output (with `--show-models`)

```shell
📦 Package Name
   Total Score: 74/100

   📊 CHAOSS Metric Models:
   ┌─────────────────────┬───────┬─────┬──────────────────┐
   │ Model               │ Score │ Max │ Observation      │
   └─────────────────────┴───────┴─────┴──────────────────┘

   🔍 Raw Signals:
   ┌─────────────────────┬───────┐
   │ Signal              │ Value │
   └─────────────────────┴───────┘
```

**CHAOSS Compatibility:** ✅ **Excellent**

- Models section matches CHAOSS "Metrics Models" concept
- Signals section provides raw data (CHAOSS principle)
- Supportive language in observations
