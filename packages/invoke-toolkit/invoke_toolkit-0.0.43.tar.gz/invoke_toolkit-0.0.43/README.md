## Features

- Task discovery by namespace for extendable/composable CLIs
- Discovery to *plain old* tasks.py (or any other name)
- Local tasks discovery from `local_tasks.py` in the current directory
- Integration with stand alone binaries for specific tasks
- **Future** Download binaries

## Do I need this package

If you have...

- Used `invoke` for a while and...
- Have a large `tasks.py` that needs to be modularized
- Have a lot of copy/pasted code in multiple `tasks.py` across multiple repos.
- Have exceeded the approach of a repository cloned as `~/tasks/` with more .py files that you want to manage.
- Or you want to combine various tasks defined in multiple directories
- You want to create a zipped (shiv) redistribute script for container environments
  like Kubernetes based CI environments with only requiring the Python interpreter.

## Installation

```console
pip install invoke-toolkit
```

## Quick Start

### Using Local Tasks

Create a `local_tasks.py` file in your project directory with your tasks:

```python
from invoke_toolkit import task

@task()
def my_task(ctx):
    """Do something useful"""
    print("Hello from local tasks!")
```

Then run it with:

```console
intk local.my-task
```

Local tasks are automatically discovered and added to the `local` namespace, allowing you to keep project-specific tasks separate from your main task collection.

## Development

This project utilizes the `pre-commit` framework, make sure you run:

`pre-commit install`

With `uvx`:

`uvx --with pre-commit-uv pre-commit install`
