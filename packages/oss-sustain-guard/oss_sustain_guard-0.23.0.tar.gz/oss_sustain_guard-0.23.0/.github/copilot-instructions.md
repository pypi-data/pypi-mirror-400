# Copilot Instructions for OSS Sustain Guard

## Project Overview

**OSS Sustain Guard** is a multi-language package sustainability analyzer that evaluates repository health metrics (contributor redundancy, maintainer retention, funding, etc.) rather than just CVEs. It supports PyPI (Python), npm (JavaScript), Cargo (Rust), Maven (Java), Kotlin, Packagist (PHP), RubyGems, NuGet (C#), Go modules, and provides holistic risk assessment via GitHub repository data.

**Key Philosophy:** Real-time analysis with local caching. Users provide GitHub token for repository analysis, with efficient local caching to minimize API calls. Multi-language support with language-specific registry resolvers.

## 💡 Project Philosophy & Core Principles

**Mission:** OSS Sustain Guard is designed to spark thoughtful conversations about open-source sustainability, not to pass judgment on projects. We aim to **raise awareness** about the challenges maintainers face and encourage the community to think together about how we can better support the open-source ecosystem.

### Core Beliefs

1. 🌱 **Sustainability matters** - Open-source projects need ongoing support to thrive
2. 🤝 **Community support is essential** - For community-driven projects, we highlight funding opportunities to help users give back
3. 📊 **Transparency helps everyone** - By providing objective metrics, we help maintainers and users make informed decisions
4. 🎯 **Respectful evaluation** - We distinguish between corporate-backed and community-driven projects, recognizing their different sustainability models
5. 💝 **Supporting maintainers** - When available, we display funding links for community projects to encourage direct support

### Design Principles for All Changes

When implementing new features or making improvements, always follow these principles:

1. **Information, not judgment** - Use supportive language instead of critical terms
   - ❌ "Risk", "Error", "Failed", "Critical"
   - ✅ "Health Status", "Observation", "Note", "Needs attention"

2. **Empathy and respect** - Consider both maintainers and users
   - Show understanding of the challenges open-source maintainers face
   - Provide actionable insights, not just warnings
   - Recognize that every project has unique circumstances

3. **Supportive messaging** - Frame observations constructively
   - Instead of "High Risk", say "Needs attention" or "Consider improving"
   - Instead of "Failed to load", say "Unable to load" or "Note: Using fallback"
   - Instead of "No funding", say "Funding information not available"

4. **Funding awareness** - Promote sustainability
   - Display funding links for community-driven projects
   - Do not show funding links for corporate-backed projects (they have different models)
   - Use encouraging language: "Consider supporting" not "Please donate"

5. **Color psychology** - Use colors thoughtfully
   - 🟢 Green: Healthy, good status
   - 🟡 Yellow: Information, needs attention, monitor
   - 🔴 Red: Needs support (not "critical failure")
   - ⚪ Gray/Dim: Informational, less important notes

6. **Metrics presentation** - Focus on observations
   - Column names: "Health Status" not "Risk", "Observation" not "Message"
   - Status labels: "Healthy", "Monitor", "Needs attention", "Needs support"
   - Avoid absolute judgments; context matters

### Examples of Philosophy in Practice

**UI Text:**
```python
# ❌ Avoid
"Error: Package failed analysis"
"Critical Risk Detected"
"Skipping excluded packages"

# ✅ Prefer
"ℹ️  Unable to complete analysis for package"
"🔍 This project needs attention in some areas"
"📋 Package excluded by configuration"
```

**Table Headers:**
```python
# ❌ Avoid
"Risk Level" | "Critical Issues" | "Failures"

# ✅ Prefer
"Health Status" | "Key Observations" | "Areas to Monitor"
```

**Status Messages:**
```python
# ❌ Avoid
"High Risk" | "Critical" | "Failed"

# ✅ Prefer
"Needs attention" | "Monitor" | "Consider improving"
```

This philosophy applies to:
- CLI output and error messages
- Documentation and README
- Code comments (internal understanding)
- User-facing text and help messages
- Metric names and descriptions

**Remember:** This tool is a conversation starter about OSS sustainability, not a judgment. Every project has unique circumstances, and metrics are just one part of the story.

## Architecture & Data Flow

### Core Modules

1. **`resolvers/`** - Multi-language package registry mappers
   - Base class: `resolvers/base.py` - `BaseResolver` with `resolve()` method
   - Language resolvers: `python.py`, `javascript.py`, `rust.py`, `java.py`, `php.py`, `ruby.py`, `csharp.py`, `go.py`
   - Each resolver maps package name → GitHub repository URL
   - Returns `tuple[str, str] | None` for (owner, repo)

2. **`config.py`** - Configuration management
   - Loads excluded packages from `.oss-sustain-guard.toml` or `pyproject.toml`
   - Priority: local `.oss-sustain-guard.toml` > `pyproject.toml`
   - Global `VERIFY_SSL` flag for SSL verification (default: True, can override with --insecure)

3. **`core.py`** - Analysis Engine & GitHub GraphQL integration
   - Main function: `analyze_repository(owner: str, repo: str) -> AnalysisResult`
   - Uses GitHub GraphQL API with `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
   - Data structures: `NamedTuple` types - `Metric` (name, score, max_score, message, risk) and `AnalysisResult` (repo_url, total_score, metrics)
   - Metric functions: `check_bus_factor()`, `check_maintainer_drain()`, `check_funding_status()`, etc.
   - Total score is sum of individual metric scores

4. **`cli.py`** - User Interface (Typer + Rich)
   - Commands: `check` (packages/requirements.txt), `--insecure` flag for SSL override
   - Loads cached data from local cache, performs real-time GitHub analysis if needed
   - Displays results in Rich-formatted tables with color-coded health status (green/yellow/red)

### Data Flow

```
Package Name → Resolver → GitHub owner/repo → core.py (GraphQL) → AnalysisResult
                                                       ↓
                                          Save to local cache
                                                       ↓
CLI: local cache → real-time GitHub analysis → Rich output
```

## Development Conventions

### Language Rules

- **Code & Documentation:** Write all code comments, docstrings, and documentation in **English**
- **Chat Response:** Respond to users in user's language
- This applies to:
  - Python docstrings and inline comments
  - Markdown documentation files
  - TOML configuration comments
  - Error messages and user-facing text

### Type Annotations & Imports

- **Use built-in types:** `list[T]`, `dict[K, V]`, `tuple[T, ...]`
- **Never** use `List`, `Dict`, `Optional` from `typing` module
- Use `SomeType | None` for optional values (PEP 604)
- `NamedTuple` for immutable data structures (preferred over dataclass for simplicity)

**Example:**
```python
def get_github_url_from_pypi(package_name: str) -> tuple[str, str] | None:
    """Returns (owner, repo) or None."""
```

### Testing & Code Quality

- **Test Framework:** `pytest` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"`
- **Linter/Formatter:** `ruff` (Python 3.10+, line-length=88, indent=4)
- **Package Manager:** `uv` (check `pyproject.toml` for dependencies)
- **Python Support:** 3.10 - 3.13

**Test Location:** `tests/test_*.py` and `tests/resolvers/test_*.py` - use mocking for external APIs (GitHub, package registries)

**Run Commands:**
```bash
uv run pytest                                    # Run all tests
uv run ruff format oss_sustain_guard tests      # Format code
uv run ruff check oss_sustain_guard tests       # Lint check
uv run python oss_sustain_guard/cli.py check <package>  # Test CLI
```

### Environment & Secrets

- Load environment variables with `load_dotenv()` (already done in `core.py`)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` required for GitHub GraphQL queries - raise `ValueError` if missing
- `VERIFY_SSL` global flag in `config.py` controls SSL verification (default: True, can be overridden with --insecure CLI flag)

## Critical Patterns

### Language Resolver Implementation

Create new resolver in `resolvers/{language}.py` inheriting from `BaseResolver`:

```python
from resolvers.base import BaseResolver

class MyResolver(BaseResolver):
    """Resolver for MyRegistry packages to GitHub URLs."""

    def resolve(self, package_name: str) -> tuple[str, str] | None:
        """Resolve package name to (owner, repo) tuple."""
        # Fetch from registry API
        # Parse GitHub URL
        # Return (owner, repo) or None on failure
```

Each resolver must:
- Inherit from `BaseResolver`
- Implement `resolve(package_name: str) -> tuple[str, str] | None` method
- Handle network errors gracefully (catch `httpx.RequestError`, return `None` on 404)
- Set `timeout=10` on HTTP requests
- Return `None` if package not found or GitHub URL cannot be extracted

### Error Handling in External APIs

Both language resolvers and `core.py` make HTTP requests. Patterns:

- **Registry API calls:** Catch `httpx.RequestError` for network failures, return `None` on 404
- **GitHub GraphQL:** Check response for `"errors"` key and raise `HTTPStatusError`
- **HTTP Timeouts:** Set `timeout=10` on all client requests

### Local Cache

**Primary**: `~/.cache/oss-sustain-guard/{ecosystem}.json.gz` (user-specific, gzip compressed)

**Format**: JSON with TTL metadata for each package entry

### ANALYSIS_VERSION Management

**CRITICAL**: When making changes that affect scoring, **ALWAYS** increment `ANALYSIS_VERSION` in `cli.py`.

**Required when:**
- ✅ Adding new metrics to analysis
- ✅ Removing or renaming existing metrics
- ✅ Changing metric scoring thresholds or logic
- ✅ Modifying scoring profile weights
- ✅ Changing `max_score` values for any metric
- ✅ Altering total score calculation method

**Not required when:**
- ❌ Fixing typos in metric messages
- ❌ Updating documentation or comments
- ❌ Refactoring code without changing logic
- ❌ Adding CLI options that don't affect scoring

**Why this matters:**
- Old cached data with different scoring logic will produce incorrect scores
- Version mismatch automatically invalidates old cache
- Users get consistent scores across cache hits/misses

**How to update:**
```python
# In cli.py
ANALYSIS_VERSION = "1.2"  # Increment when scoring changes
```

### Health Status Levels

Metric risk values: `"Critical"`, `"High"`, `"Medium"`, `"Low"`, `"None"`

CLI color mapping:
- Score < 50 → 🔴 Red (needs support)
- Score 50-79 → 🟡 Yellow (monitor)
- Score ≥ 80 → 🟢 Green (healthy)

## Key Dependencies

- `typer` - CLI framework with type hints
- `rich` - Terminal formatting (tables, colors)
- `httpx` - HTTP client (async-capable)
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable loading

## Common Tasks

**Adding a New Metric:**
1. Create `check_my_metric(repo_data: dict[str, Any]) -> Metric` in `core.py`
2. Call it in `analyze_repository()` and append to metrics list
3. Update total_score calculation
4. Add test in `test_core.py` with mocked GraphQL

**Adding a New Language Resolver:**
1. Create `resolvers/{language}.py` inheriting from `BaseResolver`
2. Implement `resolve(package_name: str) -> tuple[str, str] | None` method
3. Create corresponding test file in `tests/resolvers/test_{language}.py` with mocked HTTP responses
4. Update `cli.py` to register the new resolver in language detection logic

**Testing a New API Integration:**
- Use `@patch("httpx.Client.get")` or `@patch("httpx.Client.post")`
- Mock response with `mock_response.json.return_value = {...}`
- See resolver test files for registry mocking examples
- See `test_core.py` for GraphQL mocking examples

**Displaying CLI Results:**
- Use `rich.Table` - see `display_results()` for structure
- Add column with `table.add_column(title, style=color)`
- Color codes: `"cyan"`, `"magenta"`, `"red"`, `"yellow"`, `"green"`
