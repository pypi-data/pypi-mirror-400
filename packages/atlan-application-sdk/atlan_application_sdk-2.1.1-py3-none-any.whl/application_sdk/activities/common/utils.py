def auto_heartbeater(fn: F) -> F:
    """Decorator that automatically sends heartbeats during activity execution.

    Heartbeats are periodic signals sent from an activity to the Temporal server
    to indicate that the activity is still making progress. This decorator
    automatically sends these heartbeats at regular intervals.

    The heartbeat interval is calculated as 1/3 of the activity's configured
    heartbeat timeout. If no timeout is configured, it defaults to 120 seconds
    (resulting in a 40-second heartbeat interval).

    Args:
        fn: The activity function to be decorated. Must be an async function.

    Returns:
        The decorated activity function that includes automatic heartbeating.

    Note:
        This decorator is particularly useful for long-running activities where
        early failure detection is important. Without heartbeats, Temporal would
        have to wait for the entire activity timeout before detecting a failure.
