Create a Python script named readfile.py implementing a basic CLI.

Requirements:
1. It must accept one command-line argument: the filename.
2. It must print the *exact* contents of that file to stdout.
3. No extra text, formatting, logs, or exception messages.
4. If the file does not exist, script should exit with non-zero code.

Example:
    python3 readfile.py notes.txt
should print the contents of notes.txt exactly.

This teaches basic CLI argument handling and file IO.
