    This function dynamically compiles a Fortran subroutine from the stencils_fortran
    directory and returns a callable Python wrapper. The Fortran code is located,
    imported via fmodpy, and the specified module and stencil function are extracted
    for use in Python.

    Args:
        fortran_script (str): Name of the Fortran source file (e.g., "ice4_nucleation.F90")
            located in the stencils_fortran directory
        fortran_module (str): Name of the Fortran module within the script that contains
            the stencil subroutine
        fortran_stencil (str): Name of the specific stencil subroutine to extract from
            the module

    Returns:
        callable: The compiled Fortran subroutine as a callable Python function that can
            be invoked with appropriate arguments
