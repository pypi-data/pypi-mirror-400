"""Implements the SentenceChunker class for splitting text into chunks based on sentence boundaries.

This module provides the `SentenceChunker`, a specialized chunker that segments text
by identifying sentence endings (like periods, question marks, etc.) while adhering to
specified token count limits for each chunk. It also handles overlapping chunks and
allows customization of sentence boundary delimiters and minimum sentence lengths.
