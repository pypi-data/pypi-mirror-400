Use this tool to get automated critical analysis of your work. The main loop will:
- Review your implementation for bugs, edge cases, and improvements
- Check for security issues and best practices
- Suggest performance optimizations
- Ensure completeness and correctness
- Provide actionable feedback for improvements

Parameters:
- review_type: Type of review (CODE_QUALITY, CORRECTNESS, PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, COMPLETENESS, BEST_PRACTICES, GENERAL)
- work_description: Clear description of what you've done
- code_snippets: Optional code snippets to review (as a list of strings)
- file_paths: Optional list of file paths you've modified
- specific_concerns: Optional specific areas you want reviewed

The critic will provide harsh but constructive feedback to ensure high quality.

Example:
critic(
    review_type="CODE_QUALITY",
    work_description="Added import statements to fix undefined symbols in Go files",
    code_snippets=["import (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"github.com/luxfi/node/common\"\n)"],
