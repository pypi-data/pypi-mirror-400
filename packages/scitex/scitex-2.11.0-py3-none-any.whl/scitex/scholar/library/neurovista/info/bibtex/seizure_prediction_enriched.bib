  abstract = {<jats:p>Epileptic seizures occur due to brain abnormalities that can indirectly affect patient’s health. It occurs abruptly without any symptoms and thus increases the mortality rate of humans. Almost 1% of world’s population suffers from epileptic seizures. Prediction of seizures before the beginning of onset is beneficial for preventing seizures by medication. Nowadays, modern computational tools, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been used to predict seizures using EEG. However, EEG signals may get corrupted with background noise, and artifacts such as eye blinks and physical movements of muscles may lead to “pops” in the signal, resulting in electrical interference, which is cumbersome to detect through visual inspection for longer duration recordings. These limitations in automatic detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures are preferred, which is an essential tool for examining and scrutinizing the EEG recording more precisely. These restrictions bring our attention to present a review of automated schemes that will help neurologists categorize epileptic and nonepileptic signals. While preparing this review paper, it is observed that feature selection and classification are the main challenges in epilepsy prediction algorithms. This paper presents various techniques depending on various features and classifiers over the last few years. The methods presented will give a detailed understanding and ideas about seizure prediction and future research directions.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Objective: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder arising from anomalies of the electrical activity in the brain, affecting ~65 million individuals worldwide. Prediction methods, typically based on machine learning methods, require a large amount of data for training, in order to correctly classify seizures with small false alarm rates. Methods: In this work, we present a new database containing EEG scalp signals of 14 epileptic patients acquired at the Unit of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena, Italy. Furthermore, a patient-specific seizure prediction method, based on the detection of synchronization patterns in the EEG, is proposed and tested on the data of the database. The use of noninvasive EEG data aims to explore the possibility of developing a noninvasive monitoring/control device for the prediction of seizures. The prediction method employs synchronization measures computed over all channel pairs and a computationally inexpensive threshold-based classification approach. Results and conclusions: The experimental analysis, performed by inspection and by the proposed threshold-based classifier on all the patients of the database, shows that the features extracted by the synchronization measures are able to detect preictal and ictal states and allow the prediction of the seizures few minutes before the seizure onsets.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes recurrent seizures and sometimes loss of awareness. Around 30% of epileptic patients continue to have seizures despite taking anti-seizure medication. The ability to predict the future occurrence of seizures would enable the patients to take precautions against probable injuries and administer timely treatment to abort or control impending seizures. In this study, we introduce a Transformer-based approach called Multi-channel Vision Transformer (MViT) for automated and simultaneous learning of the spatio-temporal-spectral features in multi-channel EEG data. Continuous wavelet transform, a simple yet efficient pre-processing approach, is first used for turning the time-series EEG signals into image-like time-frequency representations named Scalograms. Each scalogram is split into a sequence of fixed-size non-overlapping patches, which are then fed as inputs to the MViT for EEG classification. Extensive experiments on three benchmark EEG datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MViT algorithm over the state-of-the-art seizure prediction methods, achieving an average prediction sensitivity of 99.80% for surface EEG and 90.28–91.15% for invasive EEG data.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Epileptic seizure prediction is one of the most used therapeutic adjuvant strategies for drug-resistant epilepsy. Conventional approaches commonly collect training and testing samples from the same patient due to inter-individual variability. However, the challenging problem of domain shift between various subjects remains unsolved, resulting in a low conversion rate to the clinic. In this work, a domain adaptation (DA)-based model is proposed to circumvent this issue. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is employed to extract the time-frequency features from raw EEG data, and an autoencoder is developed to map these features into high-dimensional space. By minimizing the inter-domain distance in the embedding space, this model learns the domain-invariant information, such that the generalization ability is improved by distribution alignment. Besides, to increase the feasibility of its application, this work mimics the data distribution under the clinical sampling situation and tests the model under this condition, which is the first study that adopts the assessment strategy. Experimental results on both intracranial and scalp EEG databases demonstrate that this method can minimize the domain gap effectively compared with previous approaches.</jats:p>},

Prediction of epileptic seizures before the beginning of the onset is quite useful for preventing the seizure by medication. Machine learning techniques and computational methods are used for predicting epileptic seizures from Electroencephalograms (EEG) signals. However, preprocessing of EEG signals for noise removal and features extraction are two major issues that have an adverse effect on both anticipation time and true positive prediction rate. Therefore, we propose a model that provides reliable methods of both preprocessing and feature extraction. Our model predicts epileptic seizures’ sufficient time before the onset of seizure starts and provides a better true positive rate. We have applied empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for preprocessing and have extracted time and frequency domain features for training a prediction model. The proposed model detects the start of the preictal state, which is the state that starts few minutes before the onset of the seizure, with a higher true positive rate compared to traditional methods, 92.23%, and maximum anticipation time of 33 minutes and average prediction time of 23.6 minutes on scalp EEG CHB-MIT dataset of 22 subjects.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Visual analysis of an electroencephalogram (EEG) by medical professionals is highly time-consuming and the information is difficult to process. To overcome these limitations, several automated seizure detection strategies have been introduced by combining signal processing and machine learning. This paper proposes a hybrid optimization-controlled ensemble classifier comprising the AdaBoost classifier, random forest (RF) classifier, and the decision tree (DT) classifier for the automatic analysis of an EEG signal dataset to predict an epileptic seizure. The EEG signal is pre-processed initially to make it suitable for feature selection. The feature selection process receives the alpha, beta, delta, theta, and gamma wave data from the EEG, where the significant features, such as statistical features, wavelet features, and entropy-based features, are extracted by the proposed hybrid seek optimization algorithm. These extracted features are fed forward to the proposed ensemble classifier that produces the predicted output. By the combination of corvid and gregarious search agent characteristics, the proposed hybrid seek optimization technique has been developed, and is used to evaluate the fusion parameters of the ensemble classifier. The suggested technique’s accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are determined to be 96.6120%, 94.6736%, and 91.3684%, respectively, for the CHB-MIT database. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the suggested technique for early seizure prediction. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the proposed technique are 95.3090%, 93.1766%, and 90.0654%, respectively, for the Siena Scalp database, again demonstrating its efficacy in the early seizure prediction process.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are the primary source for discriminating the preictal from the interictal stage, enabling early warnings before the seizure onset. Epileptic siezure prediction systems face significant challenges due to data scarcity, diversity, and privacy. This paper proposes a three-tier architecture for epileptic seizure prediction associated with the Federated Learning (FL) model, which is able to achieve enhanced capability by utilizing a significant number of seizure patterns from globally distributed patients while maintaining data privacy. The determination of the preictal state is influenced by global and local model-assisted decision making by modeling the two-level edge layer. The Spiking Encoder (SE), integrated with the Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Spiking-GCNN), works as the local model trained using a bi-timescale approach. Each local model utilizes the aggregated seizure knowledge obtained from the different medical centers through FL and determines the preictal probability in the coarse-grained personalization. The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is utilized in fine-grained personalization to recognize epileptic seizure patients by examining the outcomes of the FL model, heart rate variability features, and patient-specific clinical features. Thus, the proposed approach achieved 96.33% sensitivity and 96.14% specificity when tested on the CHB-MIT EEG dataset when modeling was performed using the bi-timescale approach and Spiking-GCNN-based epileptic pattern learning. Moreover, the adoption of federated learning greatly assists the proposed system, yielding a 96.28% higher accuracy as a result of addressing data scarcity.},

The pre-ictal period determination, characterized by a transitional stage between normal brain activity and seizure, is a critical step. Past approaches failed to attain real-world applicability due to lack of generalization capacity. More recently, deep learning techniques may outperform traditional classifiers and handle time dependencies. However, despite the existing efforts for providing interpretable insights, clinicians may not be willing to make high-stake decisions based on them. Furthermore, a disadvantageous aspect of the more usual seizure prediction pipeline is its modularity and significant independence between stages. An alternative could be the construction of a search algorithm that, while considering pipeline stages’ synergy, fine-tunes the selection of a reduced set of features that are widely used in the literature and computationally efficient. With extracranial recordings from 19 patients suffering from temporal-lobe seizures, we developed a patient-specific evolutionary optimization strategy, aiming to generate the optimal set of features for seizure prediction with a logistic regression classifier, which was tested prospectively in a total of 49 seizures and 710 h of continuous recording and performed above chance for 32% of patients, using a surrogate predictor. These results demonstrate the hypothesis of pre-ictal period identification without the loss of interpretability, which may help understanding brain dynamics leading to seizures and improve prediction algorithms.</jats:p>},

As a step toward practical implementation of this technology in humans, we present an individualized method for selecting electroencephalogram (EEG) features and electrode locations for seizure prediction focused on precursors that occur within ten minutes of electrographic seizure onset. This method applies an intelligent genetic search process to EEG signals simultaneously collected from multiple intracranial electrode contacts and multiple quantitative features derived from these signals. The algorithm is trained on a series of baseline and preseizure records and then validated on other, previously unseen data using split sample validation techniques. The performance of this method is demonstrated on multiday recordings obtained from four patients implanted with intracranial electrodes during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. An average probability of prediction (or block sensitivity) of 62.5% was achieved in this group, with an average block false positive (FP) rate of 0.2775 FP predictions/h, corresponding to 90.47% specificity. These findings are presented as an example of a method for training, testing and validating a seizure prediction system on data from individual patients. Given the heterogeneity of epilepsy, it is likely that methods of this type will be required to configure intelligent devices for treating epilepsy to each individual's neurophysiology prior to clinical deployment.},

Accurate and reliable seizure prediction systems can provide alerts before a seizure occurs, as well as give the patient and caregivers provider enough time to take appropriate measure. This study presents an effective seizure prediction method based on deep learning that combine with handcrafted features. The handcrafted features were selected by Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) to obtain the optimal set of features. To extract the epileptic features from the fused multidimensional structure, we designed a P3D-BiConvLstm3D model, which is a combination of pseudo-3D convolutional neural network (P3DCNN) and bidirectional convolutional long short-term memory 3D (BiConvLstm3D). We also converted EEG signals into a multidimensional structure that fused spatial, manual features, and temporal information. The multidimensional structure is then fed into a P3DCNN to extract spatial and manual features and feature-to-feature dependencies, followed by a BiConvLstm3D input to explore temporal dependencies while preserving the spatial features, and finally, a channel attention mechanism is implemented to emphasize the more representative information in the multichannel output. The proposed has an average accuracy of 98.13%, an average sensitivity of 98.03%, an average precision of 98.30% and an average specificity of 98.23% for the CHB-MIT scalp EEG database. A comparison of the proposed model with other baseline methods was done to confirm the better performance of features through time–space nonlinear feature fusion. The results show that the proposed P3DCNN-BiConvLstm3D-Attention3D method for epilepsy prediction by time–space nonlinear feature fusion is effective.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Epileptic seizure forecasting, combined with the delivery of preventative therapies, holds the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for epilepsy patients and their caregivers. Forecasting seizures could prevent some potentially catastrophic consequences such as injury and death in addition to several potential clinical benefits it may provide for patient care in hospitals. The challenge of seizure forecasting lies within the seemingly unpredictable transitions of brain dynamics into the ictal state. The main body of computational research on determining seizure risk has been focused solely on prediction algorithms, which involves a challenging issue of balancing sensitivity and false alarms. There have been some studies on identifying potential biomarkers for seizure forecasting; however, the questions of “What are the true biomarkers for seizure prediction” or even “Is there a valid biomarker for seizure prediction?” are yet to be fully answered. In this paper, we introduce a tool to facilitate the exploration of the potential biomarkers. We confirm using our tool that interictal slowing activities are a promising biomarker for epileptic seizure susceptibility prediction.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of epileptic seizures has remained elusive, despite the many advances in machine learning and time-series classification. In this work, we develop a convolutional network module that exploits Electroencephalogram (EEG) scalograms to distinguish between the pre-seizure and normal brain activities. Since these scalograms have rectangular image shapes with many more temporal bins than spectral bins, the presented module uses “semi-dilated convolutions” to create a proportional non-square receptive field. The proposed semi-dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field over the long dimension (image width, i.e. time) while maintaining high resolution over the short dimension (image height, i.e., frequency). The proposed architecture comprises a set of co-operative semi-dilated convolutional blocks, each block has a stack of parallel semi-dilated convolutional modules with different dilation rates. Results show that our proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving seizure prediction sensitivity scores of 88.45% and 89.52% for the American Epilepsy Society and Melbourne University EEG datasets, respectively.},

  abstract = {Objective: Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological diseases among humans and can lead to severe brain injuries, strokes, and brain tumors. Early detection of seizures can help to mitigate injuries, and can be used to aid the treatment of patients with epilepsy. The purpose of a seizure prediction system is to successfully identify the pre-ictal brain stage, which occurs before a seizure event. Patient-independent seizure prediction models are designed to offer accurate performance across multiple subjects within a dataset, and have been identified as a real-world solution to the seizure prediction problem. However, little attention has been given for designing such models to adapt to the high inter-subject variability in EEG data. Methods: We propose two patient-independent deep learning architectures with different learning strategies that can learn a global function utilizing data from multiple subjects. Results: Proposed models achieve state-of-the-art performance for seizure prediction on the CHB-MIT-EEG dataset, demonstrating 88.81% and 91.54% accuracy respectively. Conclusions: The Siamese model trained on the proposed learning strategy is able to learn patterns related to patient variations in data while predicting seizures. Significance: Our models show superior performance for patient-independent seizure prediction, and the same architecture can be used as a patient-specific classifier after model adaptation. We are the first study that employs model interpretation to understand classifier behavior for the task for seizure prediction, and we also show that the MFCC feature map utilized by our models contains predictive biomarkers related to interictal and pre-ictal brain states.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy seizure prediction paves the way of timely warning for patients to take more active and effective intervention measures. Compared to seizure detection that only identifies the inter-ictal state and the ictal state, far fewer researches have been conducted on seizure prediction because the high similarity makes it challenging to distinguish between the pre-ictal state and the inter-ictal state. In this paper, a novel solution on seizure prediction is proposed using common spatial pattern (CSP) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, artificial pre-ictal EEG signals based on the original ones are generated by combining the segmented pre-ictal signals to solve the trial imbalance problem between the two states. Secondly, a feature extractor employing wavelet packet decomposition and CSP is designed to extract the distinguishing features in both the time domain and the frequency domain. It can improve overall accuracy while reducing the training time. Finally, a shallow CNN is applied to discriminate between the pre-ictal state and the inter-ictal state. Our proposed solution is evaluated on 23 patients’ data from Boston Children's Hospital-MIT scalp EEG dataset by employing a leave-one-out cross-validation, and it achieves a sensitivity of 92.2% and false prediction rate of 0.12/h. Experimental result demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.},

Patients affected by this disease can be treated with the help of medicines or surgical procedures. However, both of these methods are not quite useful. The only method to treat epilepsy patients effectively is to predict the seizure before its onset. It has been observed that abnormal activity in the brain signals starts before the occurrence of seizure known as the preictal state. Many researchers have proposed machine learning models for prediction of epileptic seizures by detecting the start of preictal state. However, pre-processing, feature extraction and classification remains a great challenge in the prediction of preictal state. Therefore, we propose a model that uses common spatial pattern filtering and wavelet transform for preprocessing, principal component analysis for feature extraction and support vector machines for detecting preictal state.

  abstract = {<jats:p>Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease that causes persistent and severe damage to the physical and mental health of patients. Daily effective prediction of epileptic seizures is crucial for epilepsy patients especially those with refractory epilepsy. At present, a large number of deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks have been used to predict epileptic seizures and have obtained better performance than traditional machine learning methods. However, these methods usually transform the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal into a Euclidean grid structure. The conversion suffers from loss of adjacent spatial information, which results in deep learning models requiring more storage and computational consumption in the process of information fusion after information extraction. This study proposes a general Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) model architecture for predicting seizures to solve the problem of oversized seizure prediction models based on exploring the graph structure of EEG signals. As a graph classification task, the network architecture includes graph convolution layers that extract node features with one-hop neighbors, pooling layers that summarize abstract node features; and fully connected layers that implement classification, resulting in superior prediction performance and smaller network size. The experiment shows that the model has an average sensitivity of 96.51%, an average AUC of 0.92, and a model size of 15.5 k on 18 patients in the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. Compared with traditional deep learning methods, which require a large number of parameters and computational effort and are demanding in terms of storage space and energy consumption, this method is more suitable for implementation on compact, low-power wearable devices as a standard process for building a generic low-consumption graph network model on similar biomedical signals. Furthermore, the edge features of graphs can be used to make a preliminary determination of locations and types of discharge, making it more clinically interpretable.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic non-communicable disorder of the brain that affects individuals of all ages. It is caused by a sudden abnormal discharge of brain neurons leading to temporary dysfunction. In this regard, if seizures could be predicted a reasonable period of time before their occurrence, epilepsy patients could take precautions against them and improve their safety and quality of life. However, the potential that permutation entropy(PE) can be applied in human epilepsy prediction from intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings remains unclear. Here, we described the novel application of PE to track the dynamical changes of human brain activity from iEEG recordings for the epileptic seizure prediction. The iEEG signals of 19 patients were obtained from the Epilepsy Centre at the University Hospital of Freiburg. After preprocessing, PE was extracted in a sliding time window, and a support vector machine (SVM) was employed to discriminate cerebral state. Then a two-step post-processing method was applied for the purpose of prediction. The results showed that we obtained an average sensitivity (SS) of 94% and false prediction rates (FPR) with 0.111 h−1. The best results with SS of 100% and FPR of 0 h−1 were achieved for some patients. The average prediction horizon was 61.93 min, leaving sufficient treatment time before a seizure. These results indicated that applying PE as a feature to extract information and SVM for classification could predict seizures, and the presented method shows great potential in clinical seizure prediction for human.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting 0.6–0.8% of the world's population. In this neurological disorder, abnormal activity of the brain causes seizures, the nature of which tend to be sudden. Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) are used as long-term therapeutic solutions that control the condition. Of those treated with AEDs, 35% become resistant to medication. The unpredictable nature of seizures poses risks for the individual with epilepsy. It is clearly desirable to find more effective ways of preventing seizures for such patients. The automatic detection of oncoming seizures, before their actual onset, can facilitate timely intervention and hence minimize these risks. In addition, advance prediction of seizures can enrich our understanding of the epileptic brain. In this study, drawing on the body of work behind automatic seizure detection and prediction from digitised Invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) data, a prediction algorithm, ASPPR (Advance Seizure Prediction via Pre-ictal Relabeling), is described. ASPPR facilitates the learning of predictive models targeted at recognizing patterns in EEG activity that are in a specific time window in advance of a seizure. It then exploits advanced machine learning coupled with the design and selection of appropriate features from EEG signals. Results, from evaluating ASPPR independently on 21 different patients, suggest that seizures for many patients can be predicted up to 20 minutes in advance of their onset. Compared to benchmark performance represented by a mean S1-Score (harmonic mean of Sensitivity and Specificity) of 90.6% for predicting seizure onset between 0 and 5 minutes in advance, ASPPR achieves mean S1-Scores of: 96.30% for prediction between 1 and 6 minutes in advance, 96.13% for prediction between 8 and 13 minutes in advance, 94.5% for prediction between 14 and 19 minutes in advance, and 94.2% for prediction between 20 and 25 minutes in advance.},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Almost one-third of epileptic patients fail to achieve seizure control through anti-epileptic drug administration. In the scarcity of completely controlling a patient’s epilepsy, seizure prediction plays a significant role in clinical management and providing new therapeutic options such as warning or intervention devices. Seizure prediction algorithms aim to identify the preictal period that Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can capture. However, this period is associated with substantial heterogeneity, varying among patients or even between seizures from the same patient. The present work proposes a patient-specific seizure prediction algorithm using post-processing techniques to explore the existence of a set of chronological events of brain activity that precedes epileptic seizures. The study was conducted with 37 patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) from the EPILEPSIAE database. The designed methodology combines univariate linear features with a classifier based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and two post-processing techniques to handle pre-seizure temporality in an easily explainable way, employing knowledge from network theory. In the Chronological Firing Power approach, we considered the preictal as a sequence of three brain activity events separated in time. In the Cumulative Firing Power approach, we assumed the preictal period as a sequence of three overlapping events. These methodologies were compared with a control approach based on the typical machine learning pipeline. We considered a Seizure Prediction horizon (SPH) of 5 mins and analyzed several values for the Seizure Occurrence Period (SOP) duration, between 10 and 55 mins. Our results showed that the Cumulative Firing Power approach may improve the seizure prediction performance. This new strategy performed above chance for 62% of patients, whereas the control approach only validated 49% of its models.</jats:p>},

However, the transmission of a large volume of electrophysiological signals between sensors and processing apparatuses and the related computation become two major bottlenecks for seizure prediction systems due to the constrained bandwidth and limited computational resources, especially for power-critical wearable and implantable medical devices. Although many data compression methods can be adopted to compress the signals to reduce communication bandwidth requirement, they require complex compression and reconstruction procedures before the signal can be used for seizure prediction. In this paper, we propose $\text\{C\}^\{\{2\}\}$ SP-Net, a framework to jointly solve compression, prediction, and reconstruction without extra computation overhead. The framework consists of a plug-and-play in-sensor compression matrix to reduce transmission bandwidth requirements. The compressed signal can be utilized for seizure prediction without additional reconstruction steps. Reconstruction of the original signal can also be carried out in high fidelity. Compression and classification overhead from the energy consumption perspective, prediction accuracy, sensitivity, false prediction rate, and reconstruction quality of the proposed framework are evaluated using various compression ratios. The experimental results illustrate that our proposed framework is energy efficient and outperforms the competitive state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin in prediction accuracy. In particular, our proposed method produces an average loss of 0.6% in prediction accuracy with a compression ratio ranging from 1/2 to 1/16.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Epilepsy, often associated with neurodegenerative disorders following brain strokes, manifests as abnormal electrical activity bursts in the cerebral cortex, disrupting regular brain function. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings capture these distinctive brain signals, offering crucial insights into seizure detection and management. This study presents a novel approach leveraging a graph neural network (GNN) model with a heterogeneous graph representation to detect epileptic seizures from EEG data. Utilizing the well-established CHB-MIT EEG dataset for training and evaluation, the proposed method includes preprocessing steps such as signal segmentation, resampling, label encoding, normalization, and exploratory data analysis. We employed a standard train-test split with stratified sampling to ensure class distribution and reduce bias. Experimental comparisons with long short-term memory (LSTM) and recurrent neural network (RNN) models highlight the GNN’s superior performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 98.0% and demonstrating incremental improvements in precision and F1-score. These findings emphasize the efficacy of GNN in capturing spatial and temporal dependencies within EEG data, surpassing conventional deep learning techniques. Furthermore, the study highlights the model’s interpretability, which is essential for clinical decision-making. By advancing EEG-based seizure prediction methods, this research offers a robust framework for enhancing patient outcomes in epilepsy management while addressing the limitations of existing approaches.</jats:p>},

              <jats:p>Seizures in people with epilepsy were long thought to occur at random, but recent methods for seizure forecasting enable estimation of the likelihood of seizure occurrence over short horizons. These methods rely on days-long cyclical patterns of brain electrical activity and other physiological variables that determine seizure likelihood and that require measurement through long-term, multimodal recordings. In this retrospective cohort study of 15 adults with bitemporal epilepsy who had a device that provides chronic intracranial recordings, functional connectivity of hippocampal networks fluctuated in multiday cycles with patterns that mirrored cycles of seizure likelihood. A functional connectivity biomarker of seizure likelihood derived from 90 s recordings of background hippocampal activity generalized across individuals and forecasted 24 h seizure likelihood as accurately as cycle-based models requiring months-long baseline recordings. Larger, prospective studies are needed to validate this approach, but our results have the potential to make reliable seizure forecasts accessible to more people with epilepsy.</jats:p>

  abstract = {: Patients with epilepsy are affected with unexpected seizure events, which significantly diminish their quality of life. It is crucial to evaluate whether an epileptic patient’s brain state is indicative of a possible seizure occurrence so that necessary therapy or alarm can be generated on time. If seizures could be predicted before the onset, interventions may be applied to avoid further damage during seizure attack, and patients could take medications or other treatments to prevent seizures from occurring. This research describes a patient-specific technique for predicting epileptic seizures based on a hybrid model. Single layer sparse autoencoder is trained to obtain a aparse representation of the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. SVM classifier is used to categorize the sparse signal as inter-ictal or pre-ictal. Individual EEG channel analysis for seizure prediction are presented. In addition, various hidden sizes of the autoencoder for optimal sparse representation are anlyzed.The proposed model evaluates 13 patients from the CHB-MIT dataset and obtains a sensitivity of 98% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 98%. We have evaluated the performance of our hybrid strategy to both deep learning models and conventional procedures. The proposed method outperforms current seizure prediction techniques, proving its efficacy.},

Epileptic seizures are a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality across the globe. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is more crucial than ever given the increase in epileptic seizures all through the globe and their effect on individuals' lives. Epilepsy, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, thyroid disease, and many more are only some of the diseases for which machine learning approaches are being applied in prediction and diagnosis. Epilepsy is one ailment that may be treated early on to save a person's life. The main objective of this research is to use feature label extraction to the dataset in order to obtain the best ML models for epileptic seizures. In order to predict epilepsy, we used the techniques of logistic regression, SVM, linear SVM, KNN, and RNN in this study. The models employed in this research are accurate to varying degrees and have attributes including precision, recall, f1-score, and support. This study demonstrates that the model is able to accurately predict the occurrence of epilepsy. Our discoveries demonstrate that involving Examination highlight extraction in the dataset, the Regional Neural Network (RNN) model with 99.9998 % Training data accuracy and 97.78% Test data accuracy and 100% prediction probability of epilepsy seizure produces the best results and also the feature characteristics of RNN is better as compared to other models used in current research work.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an efficient and reliable epileptic seizure prediction system using intracranial EEG (iEEG) data, especially for people with drug-resistant epilepsy. The prediction procedure should yield accurate results in a fast enough fashion to alert patients of impending seizures. Methods: We quantitatively analyze the human iEEG data to obtain insights into how the human brain behaves before and between epileptic seizures. We then introduce an efficient pre-processing method for reducing the data size and converting the time-series iEEG data into an image-like format that can be used as inputs to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Further, we propose a seizure prediction algorithm that uses cooperative multi-scale CNNs for automatic feature learning of iEEG data. Results: 1) iEEG channels contain complementary information and excluding individual channels is not advisable to retain the spatial information needed for accurate prediction of epileptic seizures. 2) The traditional PCA is not a reliable method for iEEG data reduction in seizure prediction. 3) Hand-crafted iEEG features may not be suitable for reliable seizure prediction performance as the iEEG data varies between patients and over time for the same patient. 4) Seizure prediction results show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods by achieving an average sensitivity of 87.85% and AUC score of 0.84. Conclusion: Understanding how the human brain behaves before seizure attacks and far from them facilitates better designs of epileptic seizure predictors. Significance: Accurate seizure prediction algorithms can warn patients about the next seizure attack so they could avoid dangerous activities. Medications could then be administered to abort the impending seizure and minimize the risk of injury.},

In the previous works, generalized methods were inevitably used for this group of patients which were not very accurate. Our approach to solve this problem is to provide a few-shot learning method. This method, having the previous knowledge, is trained with only a small number of samples, learns new tasks and reduces the efforts to collect more data. Evaluation results for three patients from the CHB–MIT database, for a 10-min seizure prediction horizon (SPH) and a 20-min seizure occurrence period (SOP), averaged sensitivity of 95.70% and a false prediction rate (FPR) of 0.057/h and for the 5-min prediction horizon and the 25-min seizure occurrence period averaged sensitivity of 98.52% and a false prediction rate of (FPR) of 0.045/h. The proposed few-shot learning method, based on previous knowledge gained from the generalizable method, is regulated with a few new patient samples for the patient. Our results show that the accuracy obtained in this method is higher than the generalizable methods.</jats:p>},

  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects a wide range of the world population and is not limited by age. Moreover, seizures can occur anytime and anywhere because of the sudden abnormal discharge of brain neurons, leading to malfunction. The seizures of approximately 30% of epilepsy patients cannot be treated with medicines or surgery; hence these patients would benefit from a seizure prediction system to live normal lives. Thus, a system that can predict a seizure before its onset could improve not only these patients’ social lives but also their safety. Numerous seizure prediction methods have already been proposed, but the performance measures of these methods are still inadequate for a complete prediction system. Here, a seizure prediction system is proposed by exploring the advantages of multivariate entropy, which can reflect the complexity of multivariate time series over multiple scales (frequencies), called multivariate multiscale modified-distribution entropy (MM-mDistEn), with an artificial neural network (ANN). The phase-space reconstruction and estimation of the probability density between vectors provide hidden complex information. The multivariate time series property of MM-mDistEn provides more understandable information within the multichannel data and makes it possible to predict of epilepsy. Moreover, the proposed method was tested with two different analyses: simulation data analysis proves that the proposed method has strong consistency over the different parameter selections, and the results from experimental data analysis showed that the proposed entropy combined with an ANN obtains performance measures of 98.66% accuracy, 91.82% sensitivity, 99.11% specificity, and 0.84 area under the curve (AUC) value. In addition, the seizure alarm system was applied as a postprocessing step for prediction purposes, and a false alarm rate of 0.014 per hour and an average prediction time of 26.73 min before seizure onset were achieved by the proposed method. Thus, the proposed entropy as a feature extraction method combined with an ANN can predict the ictal state of epilepsy, and the results show great potential for all epilepsy patients.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Epileptic seizure prediction is one of the most used therapeutic adjuvant strategies for drug-resistant epilepsy. Conventional methods are usually trained and tested on the same patient due to the interindividual variability. However, the challenging problem of the domain shift between different subjects remains unsolved, resulting in low prevalence of clinical application. In this study, a generic model based on the domain adaptation (DA) technique is proposed to alleviate such problems. Ensemble learning is employed by developing a hierarchical vote collective of seven DA modules over multi-modality data, such that the predictive performance is improved by training multiple models. Moreover, to increase the feasibility of its implementation, this study mimics the data distribution of clinical sampling and tests the model under this simulated realistic condition. Based on the performance of seven subnetworks, the applicability of each DA algorithm for seizure prediction is evaluated, which is the first study that provides the assessment. Experimental results on both intracranial and scalp EEG databases demonstrate that this method can reduce the domain gap effectively compared with previous studies.</jats:p>},

Methods: Virus Swarm Particle Optimization Technique (VSPO) based Genetic algorithm is utilized for the purpose of feature selection and Machine Learning SVM technique is utilized for classiﬁcation of EEG signals to determine seizure or non-seizure. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is utilized for factor extraction to assess the recurrence range of EEG signals associated with seizures, to partition them into separate spaces using DWT of EEG symbols, and to consider the variations between seizure and normal functionality.

However, effort was devoted to prediction of focal seizures, while generalized seizures were regarded as stochastic events. Long-lasting local field potential (LFP) recordings containing several hundred generalized spike and wave discharges (SWDs), acquired at eight locations in the cortico-thalamic system of absence epileptic rats, were iteratively analyzed in all possible combinations of either two or three recording sites, by a wavelet-based algorithm, calculating the product of the wavelet-energy signaling increases in synchronicity. Sensitivity and false alarm rate of prediction were compared between various combinations, and wavelet spectra of true and false positive predictions were fed to a random forest machine learning algorithm to further differentiate between them. Wavelet analysis of intracortical and cortico-thalamic LFP traces showed a significantly smaller number of false alarms compared with intrathalamic combinations, while predictions based on recordings in Layers IV, V, and VI of the somatosensory-cortex significantly outreached all other combinations in terms of prediction sensitivity. In 24-h out-of-sample recordings of nine Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), containing diurnal fluctuations of SWD occurrence, classification of true and false positives by the trained random forest further reduced the false alarm rate by 71%, although at some trade-off between false alarms and sensitivity of prediction, as reflected in relatively low F1 score values. Results provide support for the cortical-focus theory of absence epilepsy and allow the conclusion that SWDs are predictable to some degree. The latter paves the way for the development of closed-loop SWD prediction-prevention systems. Suggestions for a possible translation to human data are outlined.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {One of the main areas of behavioural neuroscience is forecasting the human behaviour. Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder in which nerve cell activity in the brain becomes disrupted, causing seizures or periods of unusual behaviour, sensations and sometimes loss of consciousness. An estimated 5% of the world population has epileptic seizure but there is not any method to cure it. More than 30% of people with epilepsy cannot control seizure. Epileptic seizure prediction, refers to forecasting the occurrence of epileptic seizures, is one of the most important but challenging problems in biomedical sciences, across the world. In this research we propose a new methodology which is based on studying the EEG signals using two measures, the Hurst exponent and fractal dimension. In order to validate the proposed method, it is applied to epileptic EEG signals of patients by computing the Hurst exponent and fractal dimension, and then the results are validated versus the reference data. The results of these analyses show that we are able to forecast the onset of a seizure on average of 25.76 seconds before the time of occurrence.},

Therefore, timely prediction of seizures and intervention treatment can significantly reduce the accidental injury of patients and protect the life and health of patients. Epilepsy seizures is the result of temporal and spatial evolution, Existing deep learning methods often ignore its spatial features, in order to make better use of the temporal and spatial characteristics of epileptic EEG signals. We propose a CBAM-3D CNN-LSTM model to predict epilepsy seizures. First, we apply short-time Fourier transform(STFT) to preprocess EEG signals. Secondly, the 3D CNN model was used to extract the features of preictal stage and interictal stage from the preprocessed signals. Thirdly, Bi-LSTM is connected to 3D CNN for classification. Finally CBAM is introduced into the model. Different attention is given to the data channel and space to extract key information, so that the model can accurately extract interictal and pre-ictal features. Our proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 97.95%, a sensitivity of 98.40%, and a false alarm rate of 0.017 h−1 on 11 patients from the public CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset.

Then, we discuss the usage of electrical stimulation to probe neural circuits to obtain robust information regarding excitability. Following this, we present a review of developments in high-resolution micro-electrode technologies that enable neuroimaging across spatial scales. Finally, we present recent results from data-driven model-based analyses, which enable imaging of seizure generating mechanisms from clinical electrophysiological measurements. It is foreseeable that the field of seizure prediction will shift focus to a more probabilistic forecasting approach leading to improvements in the quality of life for the millions of people who suffer uncontrolled seizures.

  abstract = {Background Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder in which seizures cause recurrent episodes of unconsciousness or muscle convulsions, seriously affecting the patient’s work, quality of life, and health and safety. Timely prediction of seizures is critical for patients to take appropriate therapeutic measures. Accurate prediction of seizures remains a challenge due to the complex and variable nature of EEG signals. The study proposes an epileptic seizure model based on a multidimensional Transformer with recurrent neural network(LSTM-GRU) fusion for seizure classification of EEG signals. Methodology Firstly, a short-time Fourier transform was employed in the extraction of time-frequency features from EEG signals. Second, the extracted time-frequency features are learned using the Multidimensional Transformer model. Then, LSTM and GRU are then used for further learning of the time and frequency characteristics of the EEG signals. Next, the output features of LSTM and GRU are spliced and categorized using the gating mechanism. Subsequently, seizure prediction is conducted. Results The model was tested on two datasets: the Bonn EEG dataset and the CHB-MIT dataset. On the CHB-MIT dataset, the average sensitivity and average specificity of the model were 98.24% and 97.27%, respectively. On the Bonn dataset, the model obtained about 99% and about 98% accuracy on the binary classification task and the tertiary upper classification task, respectively. Conclusion The findings of the experimental investigation demonstrate that our model is capable of exploiting the temporal and frequency characteristics present within EEG signals.},

  author = {Jee Sook Ra and Tianning Li and Yan Li},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
Epilepsy is a serious brain disorder affecting more than 50 million people worldwide. If epileptic seizures can be predicted in advance, patients can take measures to avoid unfortunate consequences. Important approaches for epileptic seizure predictions are often signal transformation and classification using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. A time-frequency (TF) transformation, such as the short-term Fourier transform (STFT), has been widely used over many years but curtailed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This research focuses on decomposing epileptic EEG signals with a higher resolution so that an epileptic seizure can be predicted accurately before its episodes.


METHODS
This study applies a synchroextracting transformation (SET) and singular value decomposition (SET-SVD) to improve the time-frequency resolution. The SET is a more energy-concentrated TF representation than classical TF analysis methods.


RESULTS
The pre-seizure classification method employing a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) reached an accuracy of 99.71% (the CHB-MIT database) and 100% (the Bonn University database). The experiments on the CHB-MIT show that the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity from the SET-SVD method, compared with the results of the STFT, are increased by 8.12%, 6.24% and 13.91%, respectively. In addition, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was also used as a classifier. Its experimental results also show that the SET-SVD generates a higher accuracy, sensitivity and specificity by 5.0%, 2.41% and 11.42% than the STFT, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of two classification methods (the MLP and 1D-CNN) show that the SET-SVD has the capacity to extract more accurate information than the STFT. The 1D-CNN model is suitable for a fast and accurate patient-specific EEG classification.},

Currently, prediction methods using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) primarily focus on local features of EEG, making it challenging to simultaneously capture the spatial and temporal features from multi-channel EEGs to identify the preictal state effectively. In order to extract inherent spatial relationships among multi-channel EEGs while obtaining their temporal correlations, this study proposed an end-to-end model for the prediction of epileptic seizures by incorporating Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Low-pass filtered EEG signals were fed into the GAT module for EEG spatial feature extraction, and followed by TCN to capture temporal features, allowing the end-to-end model to acquire the spatiotemporal correlations of multi-channel EEGs.

An innovative approach for epileptic seizure prediction has been proposed to improve prediction accuracy and reduce the false alarm rate in comparison with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform was used to decompose EEG signals into different frequency resolutions, and a multiresolution convolutional neural network is designed to extract discriminative features from each frequency band. The algorithm automatically generates patient-specific features to best classify preictal and interictal segments of the subject. The method can be applied to any patient case from any dataset without the need for a handcrafted feature extraction procedure.

        <jats:p>The administration of antiepileptic drugs or surgical interventions fails to control seizures in about 30% of patients. Seizure prediction is a viable strategy for enhancing their quality of life because it can be used in intervention or warning systems. These systems may disarm seizures or, at the very least, lessen their adverse effects. Identifying the preictal interval, which marks the change from regular brain activity to a seizure, is critical to this research field. Even though several predictive studies applied various Electroencephalogram based methodologies, only some have been used in medical devices, and none have been clinically applicable. Recent studies have shown that tracking and handling data changes with time, known as concept drifts is highly relevant in seizure prediction; therefore, it is essential to develop methods able to automatically detect and address changes in context without human intervention. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the impact of automatic concept drift adapting methods in seizure prediction. We tested approaches to predict seizures while adapting to concept drifts during the model’s learning process; for that, we proposed and compared to the Control three patient-specific seizure prediction approaches with a 10-minute seizure prediction horizon: a seizure prediction algorithm incorporating a window adjustment method by optimising performance with Support Vector Machines1 (Backwards-Landmark Window), a seizure prediction algorithm incorporating a data-batch (seizures)selection method using a logistic regression2 (Seizure-batch Regression), and a seizure prediction algorithm with a dynamicintegration of classifiers3 (Dynamic Weighted Ensemble). The proposed methodologies included a retraining process after eachseizure and combined a set of univariate linear features with classifiers based on Support Vector Machines. The Firing Power wasused as a post-processing technique to generate alarms before seizures. Considering a group of 37 patients with Temporal LobeEpilepsy from the EPILEPSIAE database, the best-performing approach (Backwards-Landmark Window) aimed to select datafrom the concept closest to the preictal period of the last training seizure; this led to results of 0.75 ± 0.33 for sensitivity and 1.03 ± 1.00 for false positive rate per hour. Even though the best-performing approach statistically validated 89% of the patients with the surrogate predictor, it is necessary to determine the maximum false positive rate appropriate for each intervention system.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disorder, which causes strange perceptions, muscle spasms, sometimes seizures, and loss of awareness, associated with abnormal neuronal activity in the brain. The goal of this study is to investigate how effective connectivity (EC) changes effect on unexpected seizures prediction, as this will authorize the patients to play it safe and avoid risk. We approve the hypothesis that EC variables near seizure change significantly so seizure can be predicted in accordance with this variation. We introduce two time-variant coefficients based on standard deviation of EC on Freiburg EEG dataset by using directed transfer function and Granger causality methods and compare index changes over the course of time in five different frequency bands. Comparison of the multivariate and bivariate analysis of factors is implemented in this investigation. The performance based on the suggested methods shows the seizure occurrence period is approximately 50 min that is expected onset stated in, the maximum value of sensitivity approaching ~ 80%, and 0.33 FP/h is the false prediction rate. The findings revealed that greater accuracy and sensitivity are obtained by the designed system in comparison with the results of other works in the same condition. Even though these results still are not sufficient for clinical applications. Based on the conclusions, it can generally be observed that the greater results by DTF method are in the gamma and beta frequency bands.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>In this study, we are interested in the epilepsy seizures problem. Indeed, we used binary SVM to predict the ongoing seizures and multiclass SVM to predict different states of patients' epilepsy. Brain activity is used as an efficient source for predicting seizures, it's recorded in Electroencephalography (EEG) segments signal. We propose and compare in this paper, three ideas select channels: the highest frequency channels, the channels of the left part of the head, and the channels of the right part of the head. A features extraction stage is important to produce a rich and relevant dataset, in effect, 22 features are calculated for each segment of 5 min from EEG signal. A binary SVM is used to predict the ongoing seizures named pre-ictal, and a one-versus-all multi-class SVM is used to predict four classes (pre-ictal, ictal, inter-ictal, and post-ictal). A classification rate toward 97%, on the selected channels corpus, was achieved by SVM (binary and multiclass) with the majority of patients.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Almost one-third of epileptic patients fail to achieve seizure control through anti-epileptic drug administration. In those cases, seizure prediction plays a significant role in clinical management and therapy. Seizure prediction algorithms aim to identify the preictal period that Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can capture. However, this period is associated with substantial heterogeneity. The present work proposes patient-specific seizure prediction algorithms using post-processing techniques to explore the existence of a set of chronological brain events that precedes epileptic seizures. The study was conducted with 37 patients from the EPILEPSIAE database. The designed methodology combines univariate linear features with a classifier based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and two post-processing techniques to handle pre-seizure temporality in an easily explainable way, employing knowledge from brain network theory. In the Chronological Firing Power approach, we considered the preictal as a sequence of three brain events separated in time. In the Cumulative Firing Power approach, we assumed the preictal period as a sequence of three overlapping events. These methodologies were compared with a control approach based on the typical machine learning pipeline. Our results showed that the Cumulative Firing Power approach may improve the seizure prediction performance. This new strategy performed above chance for 62% of patients, whereas the Control approach only validated 49% of its models.},

  abstract = {The development of systems that can predict epilepsy seizures in real time offers great hope for epilepsy patients. These systems aim to prevent accidents that patients may experience due to loss of consciousness during seizures. Therefore, systems that can predict epileptic seizures should both work in real time and be designed to maintain the daily activities of the patient. In this case, a system with as few electrodes as possible should be developed. In this study, it is aimed to choose the most appropriate electrode in predicting epileptic seizures. Channel selection is made according to two parameters and its effect on seizure prediction is examined. The first parameter is the difference in variance between preictal and interictal; The other parameter is the weighted average sensitivity (WAS). The Rusboosted Tree ensemble classification is used to calculate WAS. The prediction process is carried out with the method we proposed in the previous study. For performance evaluation, prediction accuracy, sensitivity (SEN) and false alarm rates per hour (FPR) are calculated. The prediction performance for the channel selected according to the variance difference results are 69%, 70.9% and 0.054 respectively and the for the channel selected according to WAS results are 69%, 71.8% and 0.031 respectively.},

  abstract = {None of the current epileptic seizure prediction methods can widely be accepted, due to their poor consistency in performance. In this work, we have developed a novel approach to analyze intracranial EEG data. The energy of the frequency band of 4–12 Hz is obtained by wavelet transform. A dynamic model is introduced to describe the process and a hidden variable is included. The hidden variable can be considered as indicator of seizure activities. The method of particle filter associated with a neural network is used to calculate the hidden variable. Six patients' intracranial EEG data are used to test our algorithm including 39 hours of ictal EEG with 22 seizures and 70 hours of normal EEG recordings. The minimum least square error algorithm is applied to determine optimal parameters in the model adaptively. The results show that our algorithm can successfully predict 15 out of 16 seizures and the average prediction time is 38.5 minutes before seizure onset. The sensitivity is about 93.75% and the specificity (false prediction rate) is approximately 0.09 FP/h. A random predictor is used to calculate the sensitivity under significance level of 5%. Compared to the random predictor, our method achieved much better performance.},
