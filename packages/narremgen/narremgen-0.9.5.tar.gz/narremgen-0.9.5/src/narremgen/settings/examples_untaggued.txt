Text 1 – (Urban Walk) -  Wait for the green light (SN6c, DE1)
Lucas, a pedestrian, stands at the central intersection just as the morning city wakes up. It’s 9 a.m. The light is clear, and the colors of the traffic signal flicker against the buildings. The air is cool and full of movement—car engines idling, footsteps echoing across the crosswalk, and the changing light playing on the pavement.
He feels a moment’s impatience as the red signal seems to last forever. Other pedestrians fidget or check their phones, some inching forward, tempted to cross before it’s safe.
An older woman at his side glances at the light and says, “It’s safer to wait for the green light—it’s designed to protect you, not just to look nice.”
Lucas relaxes his shoulders, steps back slightly from the curb, and watches the signal with renewed attention. The world seems to pause with him.
When the green light finally appears, he crosses calmly, blending into the gentle flow of people, feeling a quiet satisfaction from having chosen the right moment.

Text 2 – (Urban Walk) -  Crossing a busy intersection (SN4, DE4)
Emma, a pedestrian, stands near a wide crosswalk at a bustling intersection. It's 9 a.m. The air vibrates with the sound of car horns and conversations, while the bright morning light glances off the windows. The noise and movement make the crossing seem even more intimidating.
Emma hesitates at the edge of the curb, scanning the traffic and watching others move with varying degrees of confidence. The rush of cars and scattered flow of people increase her uncertainty about when and how to cross.
A calm voice beside her, from another woman waiting with a shopping bag, says, “Take your time and cross when the flow of people and traffic lines up.”
Emma breathes out, watches carefully, and waits for a pause in the chaos. The group around her seems to move as one, and she senses the right moment approaching.
She steps forward, crossing in sync with the others. As she reaches the other side, her discomfort gives way to a quiet confidence.

Text 3 – (Urban Walk) -  Choosing the shady side (SN13c, DE1)
Hugo, part of a small group of older pedestrians, arrives at a wide, sunlit sidewalk just before midday. The day is bright and warm. Reflections shimmer on nearby shop windows, and the pavement radiates heat.
He pauses, shielding his eyes, uncertain about which side will be most comfortable. The sun is strong, and the air feels heavy.
A companion quietly suggests, “If you can, walk in the shade—it makes the journey easier and helps you keep your energy.”
Hugo observes the row of trees casting long shadows on one side. He nods, and together the group shifts toward the shaded path.
As they walk under the cool protection of the trees, conversation resumes, and Hugo feels lighter, enjoying the comfort and ease the shade provides.

Text 4 – (Urban Walk) -  Don’t block the passage (SN12c, DE6)
Clara, a woman in her thirties, walks with her family along a quiet street just after lunch. The pavement is damp from an earlier shower, and the afternoon is mild. Their group naturally spreads out, filling most of the narrow path.
Clara pauses to take in a storefront, momentarily blocking the passage. Behind them, she hears footsteps slow and notices a stroller waiting for space.
A gentle voice from behind says, “Just a small step to the side can let others pass more easily—everyone benefits from a clear path.”
Clara realizes her family is blocking others. She nudges her group closer to the edge, making space on the sidewalk.
As people pass smoothly, Clara feels a quiet sense of relief and the stroll continues, lighter and more relaxed for everyone.

Text 5 – (Urban Walk) - Don’t cross diagonally (SN1, DE8)
Noah, a young man, stands at the edge of a bustling shopping street around midday. The sky is cloudy, and the crowd moves quickly, weaving between shops and street performers. The flow of people seems to cut across every direction.
Noah considers crossing diagonally, tempted to take a shortcut through the crowd. But the many distractions and the shifting traffic make him hesitate.
Someone beside him says, “Crossing in a straight line at the crosswalk helps everyone see you more clearly and keeps you safer.”
He studies the painted lines and waits for a break in the stream of pedestrians. Gathering his resolve, he decides to cross directly at the marked area.
As he reaches the other side, Noah feels calmer, having chosen the safer, clearer route—and noticing others follow his example.
