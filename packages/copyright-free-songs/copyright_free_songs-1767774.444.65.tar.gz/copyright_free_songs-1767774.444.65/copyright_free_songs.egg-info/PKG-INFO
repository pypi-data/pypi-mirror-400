# copyright-free-songs

A Python library to easily access and explore a curated selection of copyright-free music, designed for integration with the Supermaker.ai music platform. Streamline your creative projects with readily available, legally cleared audio.

## Installation

Install the `copyright-free-songs` package using pip:
bash
pip install copyright-free-songs

## Basic Usage

Here are a few examples demonstrating how to use the `copyright-free-songs` library:

**1. Searching for Music by Genre:**
python
from copyright_free_songs import SongLibrary

library = SongLibrary()

songs = library.search(genre="Electronic")

if songs:
    print("Found Electronic Songs:")
    for song in songs[:3]:  # Displaying the first 3 results
        print(f"- Title: {song['title']}, Artist: {song['artist']}")
else:
    print("No songs found matching that genre.")

**2. Finding Music by Mood:**
python
from copyright_free_songs import SongLibrary

library = SongLibrary()

songs = library.search(mood="Happy")

if songs:
    print("Found Happy Songs:")
    for song in songs[:3]: # Displaying the first 3 results
        print(f"- Title: {song['title']}, Artist: {song['artist']}")
else:
    print("No songs found matching that mood.")

**3. Retrieving a Specific Song's Details:**
python
from copyright_free_songs import SongLibrary

library = SongLibrary()

song = library.get_song_details(song_id="unique_song_id_example") # Replace with a valid song ID

if song:
    print("Song Details:")
    print(f"- Title: {song['title']}")
    print(f"- Artist: {song['artist']}")
    print(f"- Genre: {song['genre']}")
    print(f"- URL: {song['url']}") # Assuming 'url' is a field in the song data
else:
    print("Song not found.")

**4. Exploring Music by Instrument:**
python
from copyright_free_songs import SongLibrary

library = SongLibrary()

songs = library.search(instrument="Piano")

if songs:
    print("Found Piano Songs:")
    for song in songs[:3]:  # Displaying the first 3 results
        print(f"- Title: {song['title']}, Artist: {song['artist']}")
else:
    print("No songs found matching that instrument.")

**5. Getting a List of Available Genres:**
python
from copyright_free_songs import SongLibrary

library = SongLibrary()

genres = library.get_available_genres()

if genres:
    print("Available Genres:")
    for genre in genres:
        print(f"- {genre}")
else:
    print("Could not retrieve available genres.")
