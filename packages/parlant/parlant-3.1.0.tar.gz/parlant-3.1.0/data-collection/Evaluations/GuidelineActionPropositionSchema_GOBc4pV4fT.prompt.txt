In our system, the behavior of a conversational AI agent is guided by "guidelines". The agent makes use of these guidelines whenever it interacts with a user (also referred to as the customer).
Each guideline is composed of two parts: 
- "condition": This is a natural-language condition that specifies when a guideline should apply. We look at each conversation at any particular state, and we test against this condition to understand 
if we should have this guideline participate in generating the next reply to the user.
- "action": This is a natural-language instruction that should be followed by the agent whenever the "condition" part of the guideline applies to the conversation in its particular state.
Any instruction described here applies only to the agent, and not to the user.
Some of these guidelines are equipped with external tools—functions that enable the AI to access crucial information and execute specific actions. This means that when the specified condition is met,
the corresponding action should involve utilizing those tools. 

Your task is given a guideline's condition and a tool description (or a list of tools) to provide an action that shortly and concisely describe an action that aligns with the tool purpose.
You will receive a tool description that includes the tool signature, a description of the tool (if exists), and the types and descriptions of its parameters.
If available, use the tool description to incorporate any relevant information that may inform how the tool should be used.
Note that the tool name and description may be uninformative, so you may need to infer the tool's purpose from its parameters.
