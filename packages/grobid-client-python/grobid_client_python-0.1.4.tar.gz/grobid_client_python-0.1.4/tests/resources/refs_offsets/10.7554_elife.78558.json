Interactions between intestinal macrophages and the enteric nervous system regulate gastrointestinal motility, yet we have an incomplete understanding of the molecular mediators of this crosstalk. Here, we identify complement component 1q (C1q) as a macrophage product that regulates gut motility. Macrophages were the predominant source of C1q in the mouse intestine and most extraintestinal tissues. Although C1q mediates the complementmediated killing of bacteria in the bloodstream, we found that C1q was not essential for the immune defense of the intestine. Instead, C1q-expressing macrophages were located in the intestinal submucosal and myenteric plexuses where they were closely associated with enteric neurons and expressed surface markers characteristic of nerve-adjacent macrophages in other tissues. Mice with a macrophage-specific deletion of C1qa showed changes in enteric neuronal gene expression, increased neurogenic activity of peristalsis, and accelerated intestinal transit. Our findings identify C1q as a key regulator of gastrointestinal motility and provide enhanced insight into the crosstalk between macrophages and the enteric nervous system.",

For example, macrophages that localize to the tissue located directly underneath the gut epithelium -known as the lamina propria -contribute to immune defense against pathogenic bacteria (Gabanyi et al., 2016). A distinct group of macrophages localizes to the tissues located beneath the lamina propria, between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers in the tissue region known as the muscularis externa. These muscularis macrophages express genes that are distinct from lamina propria macrophages (Gabanyi et al., 2016). They directly regulate the activity of smooth muscle cells (Luo et al., 2018) and secrete soluble factors, such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), which interact with the enteric neurons that control smooth muscle activity (Muller et al., 2014). Muscularis macrophages thus play a key role in regulating gut motility. However, we have a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which these macrophages regulate intestinal neuromuscular activity and gut motility.",

It is composed of six molecules each of C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC, forming a 410 kDa oligomer. C1q circulates in the bloodstream, where it participates in immune defense against infection by recognizing antibodies bound to invading bacteria. This binding interaction initiates the classical complement pathway, which entails the recruitment and proteolytic processing of other complement components that rupture the bacterial membrane and recruit phagocytic cells (Kishore and Reid, 2000;Noris and Remuzzi, 2013). C1q is also produced by microglia (brain-resident macrophage-like cells) in the brain where it promotes the pruning of neuronal synapses through an unclear mechanism (Hammond et al., 2020;Hong et al., 2016). Consequently, C1q deficiency results in heightened synaptic connectivity in the central nervous system which can lead to epilepsy (Chu et al., 2010).",

Here, we show that C1q is produced by macrophages of the mouse intestine. Intestinal C1q-expressing macrophages exhibit properties of neuromodulatory macrophages from other tissues and are located close to enteric neurons that have a known role in controlling gut motility.

Circulating C1q activates the complement pathway by binding to antibody-antigen complexes or to bacterial cell surface molecules, and thus protects against systemic infection. Therefore, we assessed whether C1q promotes the immune defense of the intestine. We first determined whether C1q exhibits characteristics of known intestinal antimicrobial proteins, including induction by the intestinal microbiota and secretion into the gut lumen. C1qa was expressed at similar levels in the small intestines of germ-free and conventionally-raised mice (Figure 3A), suggesting that C1q expression is not induced by the gut microbiota. This contrasted with Reg3g, encoding the antimicrobial protein REG3G (Cash et al., 2006), which was expressed at a > twofold higher level in conventional as compared to germ-free mice (Figure 3A). Additionally, in contrast to REG3G, C1q was not detected in the gut lumen of either conventional or germ-free mice (Figure 3B). C1qa expression was also not markedly altered by a 24 hr oral infection with the intestinal pathogenic bacterial species Salmonella Typhimurium (Figure 3C). Although we cannot rule out the induction of C1q by longer-term pathogenic infections, these data indicate that C1q is not induced by the gut microbiota or by a 24 hr infection with S. typhimurium, in contrast to other intestinal antibacterial proteins.",

      "text": "Intestinal macrophages perform distinct functions depending on their anatomical location. Macrophages in the lamina propria protect against invasion by pathogenic microbes and promote tissue repair (Grainger et al., 2017). In contrast, muscularis macrophages that reside in deeper intestinal tissues, such as the muscularis externa (Figure 4A), regulate enteric neurons and smooth muscle cells that drive gastrointestinal motility (De Schepper et al., 2018a;De Schepper et al., 2018b). Furthermore, C1q has several well-described functions in regulating the development and activity of neurons of the central nervous system (Hammond et al., 2020;Hong et al., 2016), suggesting that intestinal C1q + macrophages might interact with enteric neurons. These prior findings prompted us to characterize the anatomical localization of C1q + macrophages within mouse intestinal tissues. The enteric nervous system is a network of neurons whose cell bodies are organized into two regions of the gastrointestinal tract: the submucosal plexus and the myenteric plexus (Figure 4A).

Given that muscularis macrophages regulate enteric nervous system functions that govern gastrointestinal motility (Muller et al., 2014), we assessed whether macrophage C1q impacts gut motility. We first tested this idea by measuring gut transit time using the nonabsorbable dye Carmine Red. C1qa ΔMϕ and C1qa fl/fl littermates were gavaged with the dye and the time to the first appearance of the dye in the feces was recorded. Transit times were decreased in C1qa ΔMϕ mice relative to their C1qa fl/fl littermates, indicating accelerated gut motility (Figure 6C). This was not due to a change in the length of either the small intestine or the colon, which were unaltered in the C1qa ΔMϕ mice (Figure 6D). By contrast, gut transit time was unchanged in C3 -/-mice, suggesting that macrophage C1q impacts gut motility independent of its canonical function in the classical complement pathway (Figure 6C). Accelerated transit was also observed in the small intestines of C1qa ΔMϕ mice as assessed by rhodamine dye transit assay (Figure 6E). To assess colonic motility, we measured the expulsion time after intrarectal insertion of a glass bead and found that C1qa ΔMϕ mice had accelerated colonic motility when compared to C1qa fl/fl littermates (Figure 6F). Our results thus suggest that the absence of macrophage C1q results in defective enteric nervous system function and dysregulated gastrointestinal motility.",

C1q was originally discovered as having a role in the classical complement pathway, which tags and destroys invading microbes (Noris and Remuzzi, 2013;Schifferli et al., 1986). Circulating C1q binds to invading microorganisms and recruits additional proteins that assemble into the membrane attack complex (MAC) (Kishore and Reid, 2000). C1q-mediated MAC formation has been described primarily in the bloodstream, where the necessary accessory proteins are present at high levels (Davis et al., 1979). However, even in the absence of infection, C1q is expressed in tissues such as the brain, where it regulates neuronal development and function (Kouser et al., 2015;van Schaarenburg et al., 2016).",

There were also no major changes in cytokine expression or numbers and frequencies of intestinal immune cells that would indicate dysregulated interactions with the microbiota. Third, C1q was not required for clearance of C. rodentium, a non-disseminating enteric pathogen whose clearance requires antigen-specific IgG and complement component 3 (C3) (Belzer et al., 2011).

First, C1q-expressing macrophages were present in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses and resided close to enteric neurons. Second C1q-expressing macrophages expressed cell surface markers like those expressed by nerve-adjacent C1q-expressing macrophages in the lung (Ural et al., 2020). Third, macrophage-specific deletion of C1qa altered enteric neuronal gene expression. Finally, consistent with the altered neuronal gene expression, macrophage-specific C1qa deletion altered gastrointestinal motility in both the small and large intestines. Thus, our results suggest that the function of C1q in the intestine is similar to its function in the brain, where it regulates the development and function of neurons (Benoit and Tenner, 2011;Kouser et al., 2015;van Schaarenburg et al., 2016).",

These macrophages secrete BMP2, which activates enteric neurons that regulate colonic muscle contraction and thus colonic motility (Muller et al., 2014).

One possibility is that C1q shapes microbiota composition which, in turn, impacts gut motility. This idea is suggested by studies in zebrafish showing that a deficiency in intestinal macrophages leads to altered gut microbiota composition relative to wild-type zebrafish (Earley et al., 2018) studies in zebrafish and mice have shown that severe defects in enteric nervous system development produce changes in gut microbiota composition that are linked to dysregulated gut motility (Rolig et al., 2017;Johnson et al., 2018). However, we did not observe prominent changes in the composition of the gut microbiota in C1qa ΔMϕ mice, arguing against a central role for the microbiota in C1q-mediated regulation of gut motility. A second possibility is that the absence of C1q leads to immunological defects that alter gut transit time. This idea is consistent with studies showing that T-cell cytokines can influence gastrointestinal motility (Akiho et al., 2011). However, this seems unlikely given the lack of pronounced immunological abnormalities in the intestines of C1qa ΔMϕ mice.",

      "text": "A third possibility is that C1q changes the cell-intrinsic properties of the macrophages that express it, thus altering their interactions with neurons to influence gut motility. We explored this possibility by conducting single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on macrophages isolated from small intestinal cell suspensions (Figure 6-figure supplement 1A). We identified 11 unique macrophage clusters and found that C1qa ΔMϕ mice had alterations in at least three highly represented clusters (Figure 6figure supplement 1B). Gene set enrichment analysis of the most significantly altered clusters did not reveal any pronounced functional differences (Figure 6-figure supplement 1C). However, analysis of the differentially expressed genes across all macrophage clusters indicated lowered representation of transcripts that are linked to control of macrophage differentiation or functional states, such as Malat1, Neat1, and Etv3 (Cui et al., 2019;Gao et al., 2020;Villar et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2019;Figure 6-figure supplement 1D). Furthermore, a recent study identified a set of 13 'microglia-specific genes' that represent a unique transcriptional overlap between microglia in the CNS and intestinal macrophages (Verheijden et al., 2015). In macrophages from C1qa fl/fl mice, we observed the expression of eight 'microglia-specific genes' whose expression was lowered or lost in macrophages from C1qa ΔMϕ mice (Figure 6-figure supplement 1E). Thus, it is possible that altered intestinal motility could arise in part from cell-intrinsic functional alterations in C1q-deficient intestinal macrophages. Such alterations could arise from a C1q autocrine signaling loop or C1q could imprint a neuronal function that feeds back to regulate macrophage gene expression as exemplified in Muller et al., 2014. A fourth possibility is that C1q + macrophages engulf specific neurons. Indeed, macrophages restrain neurogenesis in the enteric nervous system through phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons, which is consistent with the ability of C1q to opsonize dying host cells (Kulkarni et al., 2017;Botto et al., 1998;Korb and Ahearn, 1997). However, we observed no marked differences in the overall numbers of enteric neurons or numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons when comparing C1qa ΔMϕ and C1qa fl/fl mice, which argues against this possibility. A fifth possibility is that C1q acts directly on enteric smooth muscle cells that regulate gut motility. Although we cannot rule out this possibility, our transcriptional profile of the colonic myenteric plexus of C1qa ΔMϕ mice suggests that most of the transcriptional changes were associated with neuronal function and homeostasis.",

Indeed, singlecell RNAseq analysis shows that macrophages recovered from the human intestinal muscularis selectively express C1q when compared to lamina propria macrophages (Domanska et al., 2022). Dysregulated peristalsis is a characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (Vrees et al., 2002) and is present in a subset of inflammatory bowel disease patients (Bassotti et al., 2014). Our finding that macrophage C1q regulates gut motility could suggest new strategies to prevent or treat these diseases. Additionally, most humans with C1q deficiency develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Since C1q can target cellular debris for phagocytosis, it is thought that C1q deficiency results in increased exposure of self-antigen to the immune system, thereby reducing immune tolerance and causing autoimmune disease (Macedo and Isaac, 2016). Furthermore, roughly 42.5% of SLE patients report gastrointestinal symptoms that range from acute abdominal pain to chronic intestinal obstruction (Fawzy et al., 2016;Tian and Zhang, 2010). The exact cause of these symptoms is unclear. Given that C1q deficiency is strongly correlated with SLE in humans and alters gut motility in mice, we suggest that C1q could be a therapeutic target for SLE patients that present with chronic constipation or other forms of dysregulated intestinal motility.",

Briefly, intestines were dissected from mice and Peyer's patches were removed. Intestines were cut into small pieces and thoroughly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (PBS-FBS). Epithelial cells were removed by incubating intestinal tissues in Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 2 mM EDTA, followed by extensive washing with PBS-FBS. Residual tissues were digested twice with Collagenase IV (Sigma), DNase I (Sigma), and Dispase (BD Biosciences) for 45 min at 37 °C with agitation. Cells were filtered through 70 μm cell strainers (Thermo Fisher) and applied onto a 40%:80% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare). Subepithelial cell populations were recovered at the interface of the 40% and 80% fractions. For small intestinal cell suspensions, the epithelial fraction was kept and combined with enzymatically liberated subepithelial cells. Cells were washed with 2 mM EDTA/3% FBS in PBS and Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (93). Cells were then stained with the viability dye Ghost 710 (Tonbo Biosciences) followed by antibodies against cell surface markers including anti-CD45 (30-F11), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-MHCII (M5/114.15.2), anti-F4/80 (BM8), anti-CD3 (17A2), anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD19 (1D3), anti-B220 (RA3-6B2), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-CD169 (3D6.112), anti-TREM2 (237920), and anti-LY6C (RB6-8C5). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with the eBioscience FOXP3/Transcription Factor Fixation/Permeabilization buffer set (Thermo Fisher) and then subjected to intracellular staining with anti-C1Q (RmC7H8), anti-FOXP3 (FJK-16s), anti-GATA3 (L50), anti-T-BET (4B10), anti-RORγ (AFKJS-9), and anti-ARG1 (P05089).

GO biological processes associated with neurons are in bold type. The dotted line indicates the cutoff for statistical significance. Five mice per group were analyzed as pooled biological replicates. Data are available from the Sequence Read Archive under BioProject ID PRJNA793870. (B) The colonic longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus of C1qa ∆Mφ mice have a transcriptional profile like that of mice with a gastrointestinal motility disorder. RNA-seq was performed on the colonic longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus from five C1qa fl/fl and five C1qa ∆Mφ littermates. Genes that were differentially expressed are represented in a heatmap that depicts log 2 (fold change). Genes that also showed altered expression in the TashT mouse line, which is a model of human Hirschsprung's disease (Bergeron et al., 2015), are indicated in red. Statistical significance of the overlap between differentially expressed genes in C1qa ∆Mφ and TashT mice was determined by Fisher's exact test (p=0.0032).
