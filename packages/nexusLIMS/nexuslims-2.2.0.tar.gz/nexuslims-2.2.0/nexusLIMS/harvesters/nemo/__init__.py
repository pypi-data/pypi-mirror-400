    Create reservation event from session.

    Create an internal
    :py:class:`~nexusLIMS.harvesters.reservation_event.ReservationEvent` representation
    of a session by finding a matching reservation in the NEMO
    system and parsing the data contained within into a ``ReservationEvent``.

    This method assumes a certain format for the "reservation questions"
    associated with each reservation and parses that information into the resulting
    ``ReservationEvent``. The most critical of these is the ``data_consent`` field.
    If an affirmative response in this field is not found (because the user declined
    consent or the reservation questions are missing), a record will not be built.

    The following JSON object represents a minimal schema for a set of NEMO "Reservation
    Questions" that will satisfy the expectations of this method. Please see the
    NEMO documentation on this feature for more details.
