eformer: A JAX-based library for efficient transformer implementations.

The eformer library provides utilities for building, training, and deploying
transformer models with JAX. It includes support for:

- Distributed training and sharding strategies via the escale module
- Quantization support (NF4, INT8) through the jaximus implicit array system
- Argument parsing utilities for dataclass-based configurations
- Universal path handling for local and cloud storage (GCS)
- Logging and profiling utilities

Submodules:
    aparser: Dataclass-based argument parsing utilities.
    common_types: Type aliases and constants for JAX/sharding configurations.
    escale: Distributed execution and mesh creation utilities.
    executor: Training execution helpers.
    jaximus: Implicit array system for lazy/quantized array handling.
    loggings: Logging utilities with colored output and progress tracking.
    mpric: Multi-process RPC utilities.
    optimizers: Optimizer implementations and wrappers.
    paths: Universal path utilities for local and cloud storage.
    pytree: JAX pytree utilities.
    serialization: Model serialization and checkpointing.

Example:
    >>> import eformer
    >>> from eformer.jaximus import ImplicitArray, implicit
    >>> from eformer.paths import ePath
    >>>
    >>> # Load data from GCS or local filesystem
    >>> data = ePath("gs://bucket/data.npy").read_bytes()
    >>>
    >>> # Use implicit arrays for memory-efficient operations
    >>> @implicit
    ... def forward(x, weights):
    ...     return x @ weights
