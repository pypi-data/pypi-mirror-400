    """
    Initializes a new span and logs its start at the TRACE level and duration at the INFO level by default.

    Args:
        name: The name of the span. If None, the name will be derived from the calling frame. Usually the function name.
        state: A dictionary of extra data to log that is attached to each trace.
        trace_id: The trace ID to use for the span. If None, a random ID will be generated.
        parent_id: The parent ID to use for the span. If None, the parent ID will be derived from the parent span.
        on_finally: A callback to be called after the span is finished.
        kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to each trace.

    Returns:
        The newly created span.
