        baudrate: The baud rate for the serial communication.
        read_line_termination: character that terminates a line when reading from the device.
        write_line_termination: character that terminates a line when wrtiting to the device.
        keep_alive: Flag indicating whether to keep the connection open between operations.
        delays: Dictionary containing delay times for in between serial operations.
            Default serial delays for serial devices. Available keys are:

                * "write": Time to wait after writing a command to the device.
