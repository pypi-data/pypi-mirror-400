### Usage

```python
from hms_commander import HmsM3Model

# List all HMS projects
projects = HmsM3Model.list_projects()

# Get projects for a specific model
brays_projects = HmsM3Model.list_projects(model_id='D')

# Extract a project
path = HmsM3Model.extract_project('D', 'D100-00-00')
```

### Notes

1. All projects use HMS 3.x format (requires `python2_compatible=True` for Jython execution)
2. Most projects use Metric units
3. Design storms are based on HCFCD rainfall regions (not Atlas 14)
4. Models K and L share some HMS projects (Cypress Creek watershed)
5. Model G (San Jacinto River) has the most HMS projects (16)
6. Some unit IDs have duplicate paths (alternate versions)
