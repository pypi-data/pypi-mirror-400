# HWComponents
The HWComponents (Hardware Components) package, part of the
[CiMLoop](https://github.com/mit-emze/cimloop) project, provides an interface for the
estimation of area, energy, latency, and leak power of hardware components in hardware
architectures. Key features in HWComponents include:

[Information about the package is available on the hwcomponents website](https://accelergy-project.github.io/hwcomponents/).
