"""Highway DSL MCP Server - Wraps the dsl.rodmena.app API.

This MCP server exposes the Highway DSL generation service to MCP clients,
allowing LLMs to generate workflows via natural language.

Usage:
    # Run as stdio server (for Claude Desktop)
    highway-dsl-client

    # Or directly
    python -m highway_dsl.mcp_client_server

Use the generate_workflow tool to create workflows from natural language descriptions.
The tool returns pure Python code that defines a Highway DSL workflow.

Example usage:
- "Create a workflow that fetches data from an API and sends an email"
- "Build a parallel workflow with 3 branches that process files"
- "Make a workflow with retry logic for flaky HTTP requests"

## Available Tools

### generate_workflow
Generate a Highway DSL workflow from natural language.

**Usage:** Describe what you want the workflow to do, and the service will generate valid Python code.

**Example descriptions:**
- "Create a workflow with 3 parallel tasks that run shell commands"
- "Build an ETL pipeline that fetches data, transforms it, and loads to database"
- "Make a workflow that calls an LLM to summarize text and emails the result"

### check_service_health
Check if the generation service is online and available.

## Notes
- Generated code uses Highway DSL (from highway_dsl import WorkflowBuilder)
- Code ends with: print(get_workflow().to_json())
- Parallel workflows include explicit wait tasks
