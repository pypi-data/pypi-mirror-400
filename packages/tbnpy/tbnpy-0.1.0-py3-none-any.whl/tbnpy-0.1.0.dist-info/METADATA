# tbnpy

**tbnpy** is a Python toolkit for **tensor-based Bayesian networks (TBNs)**, designed for scalable probabilistic inference in systems with large, structured state spaces.  
It is particularly suited to applications where classical Bayesian network implementations struggle due to combinatorial growth in system states.

The package provides:
- A tensor-based formulation of Bayesian networks
- Scalable exact and approximate inference algorithms
- Support for hybrid discrete–continuous models
- Reusable system-level rules and probabilistic components
- Examples illustrating end-to-end modelling and inference workflows

## Documentation

📘 **Full documentation is available here:**  
👉 https://jieunbyun.github.io/tbnpy/

The online documentation includes:
- Conceptual overview of tensor-based Bayesian networks
- Installation and getting-started guides
- API reference for all core modules
- Worked examples (including the ABCDE example)
- Repository structure and design rationale
