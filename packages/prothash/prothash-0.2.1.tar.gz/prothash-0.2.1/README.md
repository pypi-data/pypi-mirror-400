# ESMC ProtHash

A protein language model that outputs amino acid sequence embeddings for use in clustering, classification, locality-sensitive hashing, and more. Distilled from the [ESMC](https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/blog/esm-cambrian) family of models, ProtHash produces contextual embeddings that align in vector space according to the sequences' underlying biological properties such as structure and function. Trained on the [SwissProt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/andrewdalpino/SwissProt-Gene-Ontology) dataset to mimic the activations of its ESMC teacher model, ProtHash embeddings have near-perfect similarity to ESMC embeddings but at a greatly reduced computational cost.

## Key Features

- **Blazing fast and efficient**: ProtHash uses less than 1.5% of its ESMC teacher's total parameters to achieve near-perfect cosine similarity between the two embedding spaces.

- **Biologically-relevant**: Biologically similar proteins will show up nearby in the embedding space enabling downstream tasks such as clustering, classification, and locality-sensitive hashing.

- **Compatible with ESMC**: ProtHash can output embeddings in its native or ESMC teacher's dimensionality - allowing it to serve as either a faster drop-in approximation to ESMC embeddings or a more efficient compressed representation.

- **Quantization-ready**: With quantization-aware post-training, ProtHash allows you to quantize the weights of the model while maintaining its near-perfect similarity to the teacher's embedding space.

## Example

First, you'll need the `prothash` and `esm` packages installed into your environment. For ProtHash version 1 use library version `0.1.x` and for version 2 install library version `0.2.x`. We recommend using a virtual environment such as Python's `venv` module to prevent version conflicts with other packages.

### Version 1

```sh
pip install prothash~=0.1.0 esm
```

### Version 2

```sh
pip install prothash~=0.2.0 esm
```

Then, load the weights from HuggingFace Hub, tokenize a protein sequence, and pass it to the model. ProtHash adopts the ESM tokenizer as it's amino acids tokenization scheme which consists of a vocabulary of 33 amino acid and special tokens. The output will be an embedding vector that can be used in downstream tasks such as comparing to other protein sequence embeddings, clustering, and near-duplicate detection.

```python
import torch

from esm.tokenization import EsmSequenceTokenizer

from prothash.model import ProtHash

tokenizer = EsmSequenceTokenizer()

model_name = "andrewdalpino/ProtHash-V2-512-Tiny"

model = ProtHash.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Optionally quantize the weights to Int8.
model.quantize_weights()

sequence = input("Enter a sequence: ")

out = tokenizer(sequence, max_length=2048)

tokens = out["input_ids"]

# Input is a [1, T] tensor of token indices. 
x = torch.tensor(tokens, dtype=torch.int64).unsqueeze(0)

# Output the sequence embedding in native dimensionality.
y_embed_native = model.embed_native(x).squeeze(0)

# Output a drop-in replacement for the teacher's embeddings.
y_embed_teacher = model.embed_teacher(x).squeeze(0)

print(y_embed_native.shape)
print(y_embed_teacher.shape)
```

## Training

If you want to train your own custom ProtHash model then follow the instructions below.

### Clone the project repo

We'll need the code from the project repository to train and/or fine-tune the model.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andrewdalpino/ProtHash
```

### Install Project Dependencies

Project dependencies are specified in the requirements.txt file. You can install them with pip using the following command from the project root. We recommend using a virtual environment such as `venv` to keep package dependencies on your system tidy.

python -m venv ./.venv

source ./.venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Distilling

ProtHash is trained to mimic the activations of its ESMC teacher model. To begin distillation with the default arguments check the example below.

```sh
python train.py
```

You can change the default arguments like in the example below.

```sh
python train --teacher_name="esmc_300m" --max_steps=4200 --embedding_dimensions=768 --temperature=4.0
```

#### Training Dashboard

We use [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) to capture and display training events such as loss and gradient norm updates. To launch the dashboard server run the following command from the terminal.

```sh
tensorboard --logdir=./runs
```

Then navigate to the dashboard using your favorite web browser.
