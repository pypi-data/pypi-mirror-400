    "# Fibonacci Hashing Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the principles and benefits of Fibonacci hashing, a multiplicative hashing technique that efficiently maps hash values to indices in power-of-2 sized hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Fibonacci Hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fibonacci hashing is a multiplicative hashing method that uses the golden ratio to distribute hash values uniformly across a hash table. The technique is particularly effective for power-of-2 sized tables and is used in high-performance systems like Java's HashMap and Python's dict implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Magic Constant**: The value `11400714819323198485`, derived from `2^64 / φ` (where φ is the golden ratio ≈ 1.618)\n",
    "2. **Multiplication**: The hash value is multiplied by the magic constant\n",
    "3. **Bit Shift**: The high-order bits are extracted via right shift to get the final index\n",
    "4. **Power-of-2 Tables**: The method works best with hash table sizes that are powers of 2 (8, 16, 32, 1024, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Fibonacci Hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniform Distribution**: Distributes hash values evenly across the table\n",
    "- **Performance**: Fast computation using only multiplication and bit shift\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Elegant mathematical foundation\n",
    "- **Proven**: Used in production systems for decades\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll compare Fibonacci hashing against two traditional approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modulo Hashing**: `index = hash_value % table_size` (simple but slower)\n",
    "2. **Bitwise AND**: `index = hash_value & (table_size - 1)` (fast but poor distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how these methods perform!"
