class Copyist(BranchActivation, CodedTool):
    """
    CodedTool implementation of a copyist for the copy_cat reservations example.

    The copyist needs at least a single argument, which is an existing "agent_name",
    reads that hocon file in and makes a temporary agent out of it.

    Optionally, there might be a "call_text" argument. If that is there, then immediately
    invoke the reservation's network with that input.

    The idea is merely to have a proof of concept surrounding the Reservations infrastructure.

    ---

    Upon activation by the agent hierarchy, a CodedTool will have its
    invoke() call called by the system.

    Implementations are expected to clean up after themselves.

        Called when the coded tool is invoked asynchronously by the agent hierarchy.
        Strongly consider overriding this method instead of the "easier" synchronous
        version above when the possibility of making any kind of call that could block
        (like sleep() or a socket read/write out to a web service) is within the
        scope of your CodedTool.

        :param sly_data: A dictionary whose keys are defined by the agent hierarchy,
                but whose values are meant to be kept out of the chat stream.

                This dictionary is largely to be treated as read-only.
                It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not
                yet exist as a bulletin board, as long as the responsibility
                for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood
                by the agent chain implementation and the coded_tool implementation
                adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than once.
