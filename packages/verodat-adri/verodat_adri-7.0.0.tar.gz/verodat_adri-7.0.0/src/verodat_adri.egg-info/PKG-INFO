              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, merge, publish,
              distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, and to
              permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so, subject to
              the following conditions:
        
              The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
              included in all copies or substantial portions of the Work.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright notice to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. When redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# ADRI - Agent Data Readiness Index

**AI agents break on bad data. ADRI fixes that with one decorator.**

```python
from adri import adri_protected

@adri_protected(standard="customer_data", data_param="data")
def process_customers(data):
    # Your agent logic here
    return results
```

Auto-validates data quality. Works with any framework. 2 minutes to integrate.

---

## ADRI = Data Contracts for AI Agents

**Think of ADRI standards as executable data contracts** - formal agreements that define what good data looks like and automatically enforce those agreements at runtime.

**Traditional approach**: Documentation says "email must be valid" → agents break when it's not  
**ADRI approach**: Contract defines email validation → invalid emails automatically blocked

```yaml
# Your data contract (auto-generated from good data)
field_requirements:
  email:
    type: string
    nullable: false
    pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
    validation_rules:
      - name: email format validation
        severity: CRITICAL
        rule_expression: REGEX_MATCH('...')
```

**Contract benefits:**
- 📋 **Schema Contract**: Field names and types must match
- ✅ **Quality Contract**: Validation rules must pass  
- 📊 **SLA Contract**: Quality scores must meet thresholds
- 🔒 **Enforcement**: Violations blocked before reaching agents

This aligns ADRI with modern data architectures: **Data Mesh** (domain-owned contracts), **Data Fabric** (unified enforcement), **DataOps** (automated quality gates).

    style F fill:#fafafa,stroke:#757575,stroke-width:1px
```

**In plain English:** ADRI sits between your code and its data, checking quality before letting data through. Good data passes, bad data gets blocked.

---

## What is ADRI?

ADRI is **the missing data layer for AI agents**. It protects your AI agent workflows from bad data by:

- **Auto-validating data quality** across 5 dimensions (validity, completeness, consistency, accuracy, timeliness)
- **Auto-generating quality standards** on first successful run - no manual configuration
- **Blocking or warning** on quality failures based on your preference
- **Logging insights locally** for debugging and development

**Framework agnostic**: Works with LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Haystack, Semantic Kernel, and any Python function.

## Why ADRI?

AI agents are powerful, but fragile. One malformed field or missing value can crash your entire workflow. Traditional validation is tedious - you write dozens of `if` statements, manually check types, and hope you caught everything.

**ADRI learns what good data looks like** and enforces it automatically. Add one decorator, run with good data once, and you're protected.

## Complete Example

```python
from adri import adri_protected
import pandas as pd

@adri_protected(standard="customer_data", data_param="customer_data")
def analyze_customers(customer_data):
    """Your AI agent logic."""
    print(f"Analyzing {len(customer_data)} customers")
    return {"status": "complete"}

# First run with good data
customers = pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2, 3],
    "email": ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com", "user3@example.com"],
    "signup_date": ["2024-01-01", "2024-01-02", "2024-01-03"]
})

analyze_customers(customers)  # ✅ Runs, auto-generates standard
```

**What happened:**
1. Function executed successfully
2. ADRI analyzed the data structure
3. Generated quality standard in `ADRI/dev/standards/customer_data.yaml`
4. Future runs validate against this standard

**Future runs with bad data:**
```python
bad_customers = pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2, None],  # Missing ID
    "email": ["user1@example.com", "invalid-email", "user3@example.com"],  # Bad email
    # Missing signup_date column
})

analyze_customers(bad_customers)  # ❌ Raises exception with quality report
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install adri
```

**Requirements**: Python 3.10+

## Features

### 🎯 One Decorator, Complete Protection

```python
@adri_protected(standard="your_data", data_param="data")
def your_function(data):
    return results
```

### 🤖 Framework Agnostic

Works with any AI agent framework:
- LangChain & LangGraph
- CrewAI
- AutoGen
- LlamaIndex
- Haystack
- Semantic Kernel
- Generic Python

### 📊 Five Quality Dimensions

ADRI validates:
1. **Validity** - Data types and formats
2. **Completeness** - Required fields present
3. **Consistency** - Cross-field relationships
4. **Accuracy** - Value ranges and patterns
5. **Timeliness** - Data freshness

### 🔄 Auto-Generation

No manual configuration. ADRI learns from your data:
- Runs successfully with good data → generates standard
- Future runs → validates against standard
- Customize generated standards as needed

### 🛡️ Protection Modes

```python
# Raise mode (default) - raises exception
@adri_protected(standard="data", data_param="data", on_failure="raise")

# Warn mode - logs warning, continues
@adri_protected(standard="data", data_param="data", on_failure="warn")

# Continue mode - silently continues
@adri_protected(standard="data", data_param="data", on_failure="continue")
```

## Common Use Cases

### API Data Validation
```python
@adri_protected(standard="api_response", data_param="response")
def process_api_data(response):
    return transform(response)
```
**What it protects**: API response data structure
**Sample data**: [examples/data/api_response.json](examples/data/api_response.json)
**Use when**: Validating third-party API responses before processing

### Multi-Agent Workflows
```python
@adri_protected(standard="crew_context", data_param="context")
def crew_task(context):
    return crew.kickoff(context)
```
**What it protects**: Agent communication context
**Sample data**: [examples/data/crew_context.json](examples/data/crew_context.json)
**Use when**: Coordinating multi-agent workflows (CrewAI, AutoGen, custom)

### RAG Pipelines
```python
@adri_protected(standard="documents", data_param="docs")
def index_documents(docs):
    return index.insert(docs)
```
**What it protects**: Document structure before indexing
**Sample data**: [examples/data/rag_documents.json](examples/data/rag_documents.json)
**Use when**: Validating documents before vector store indexing (LlamaIndex, Haystack)

> **Note**: ADRI validates data structure, not content. For RAG, it ensures each document has required fields (id, text, metadata) and correct types, preventing indexing failures from malformed data.
