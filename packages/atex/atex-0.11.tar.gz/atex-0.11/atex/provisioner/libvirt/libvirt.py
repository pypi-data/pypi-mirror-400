    (This image name is presumably a fresh OS install made by 3rd party logic.)

    This allows concurrent access by multiple users (no domains are created
    or removed, just taken/released) and fast provisioning times (volume cloning
    is much faster than Anaconda installs).

    Access to the libvirt host is via ssh, but the remote user does not need to

        'host' is a ManagedSSHConnection class instance, connected to a libvirt host.

        'image' is a string with a libvirt storage volume name inside the
        given storage 'pool' that should be used as the source for cloning.

        'pool' is a libvirt storage pool used by all relevant domains on the
        libvirt host **as well as** the would-be-cloned images.

        'domain_filter' is a regex string matching libvirt domain names to
        attempt reservation on. Useful for including only ie. 'auto-.*' domains
        while leaving other domains on the same libvirt host untouched.

        'domain_user' and 'domain_sshkey' (strings) specify how to connect to
        an OS booted from the pre-instaled 'image', as these credentials are
        known only to the logic that created the 'image' in the first place.

        'reserve_delay' is an int of how many seconds to wait between trying to
        lock libvirt domains, after every unsuccessful locking attempt.
        Ie. with delay=5 and 20 domains, the code will try to lock every domain
        in 5*20=100 seconds before looping back to the first.

        'reserve_time' is an int of maximum seconds to reserve a libvirt domain
        for before other users can steal it for themselves. Note that there is
        no automatic timeout release logic, it's just a hint for others.

        'start_event_loop' set to True starts a global default libvirt event
        loop as part of .start() (or context manager enter) in a background
        daemon thread.
        This is necessary to maintain connection keep-alives, but if you plan
        on managing the loop yourself (have custom uses for the libvirt module),
