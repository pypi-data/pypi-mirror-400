    Abstract base class for a scalable, persistent, transactional container of :py:class:`~architxt.tree.Tree` objects.

    ``TreeBucket`` behaves like a :py:class:`set` while providing durable storage and explicit transactional
    semantics. It is designed for large-scale data and supports millions of trees with bounded
    memory usage through batched commits.

    **Transaction Management**

    - Adding or removing trees requires an active transaction.
    - Modifying a tree that is already in a bucket is not possible without a transaction.
      The modifications are automatically persisted when the transaction is committed.
    - Exceptions inside a ``with bucket.transaction():`` block automatically roll back the transaction.

    **Available Implementations**
