You are given a unit test file named test_utils.py (assume DevOpsMind provides it).

Your task:
1. Create a file named utils.py.
2. Implement a function multiply(a, b) that returns a * b.
3. Running `pytest -q` must show all tests passing.

This simulates TDD-driven development and ensures learners can write code to satisfy an existing test suite.
