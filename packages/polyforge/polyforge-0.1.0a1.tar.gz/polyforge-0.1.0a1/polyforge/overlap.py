"""Overlap resolution utilities.

The previous package structure split these helpers between ``overlap/__init__.py``
and ``overlap/engine.py``. Consolidating them into a single module keeps all of
the overlap-specific logic in one place and eliminates the extra wrapper file
(``split.py``) that simply forwarded to ``resolve_overlap_pair``.
