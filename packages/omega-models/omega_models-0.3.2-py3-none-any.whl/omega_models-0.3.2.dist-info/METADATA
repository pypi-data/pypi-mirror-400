# Omega: A Library of AI Invented Machine Learning Algorithms

Omega is an open-source Python library containing novel machine learning algorithms generated through automated algorithmic synthesis techniques. These algorithms push the boundaries of traditional machine learning approaches and offer unique capabilities for tackling complex data analysis tasks.

## Key Features

- **Novel Algorithms**: Includes machine learning algorithms not found in other libraries, created through evolutionary computation and neural architecture search.
- **Simple Scikit-Learn Style Interface**: Follows scikit-learn API conventions for easy integration into existing ML pipelines.

## Installation

```bash
pip install omega-models
```

## Quick Start

```python
from omega_models import DimAwareForest

# Load your dataset
X, y = load_dataset()

# Initialize and train the model
model = DimAwareForest()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
