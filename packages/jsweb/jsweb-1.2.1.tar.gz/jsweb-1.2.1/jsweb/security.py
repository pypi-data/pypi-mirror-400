    A decorator to add headers to a response to prevent browser caching.

    This is crucial for pages that show sensitive or user-specific data,
    like a profile page, to prevent the back-forward cache from showing
    stale, logged-in content after a user has logged out. It sets the
    'Cache-Control', 'Pragma', and 'Expires' headers to strongly discourage
    caching by browsers and proxies.
