As we have seen in previous examples, reading a PDF is not a simple task. In this case, we will see how to read a PDF using the **MarkItDown** framework, and connect this library to Visual Language Models (VLMs) to extract text or get annotations from images.

## How to connect a VLM to MarkItDownReader

For this example, we will use the same document as the [previous tutorial](https://github.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR/blob/main/data/sample_pdf.pdf).

To extract image descriptions or perform OCR, instantiate any model that implements the [`BaseModel` interface](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/model/#basemodel) (vision variants inherit from it) and pass it into the [`MarkItDownReader`](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/api_reference/reader/#markitdownreader). Swapping providers only changes the model constructor; your Reader usage remains the same.

### Instantiation examples

<details>
  <summary><strong>Show/hide instantiation snippets for all providers</strong></summary>

  <h4>OpenAI</h4>

```python
from splitter_mr.model import OpenAIVisionModel

# Reads OPENAI_API_KEY (and optional OPENAI_MODEL) from .env if present
model = OpenAIVisionModel()
# or pass explicitly:
# model = OpenAIVisionModel(api_key="...", model_name="gpt-4o")
```

  <h4>Azure OpenAI</h4>

```python
from splitter_mr.model import AzureOpenAIVisionModel

# Reads Azure vars from .env if present
model = AzureOpenAIVisionModel()
# or:
# model = AzureOpenAIVisionModel(
#     api_key="...",
#     azure_endpoint="https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/",
#     api_version="2024-02-15-preview",
#     azure_deployment="<your-deployment-name>",
# )
```

  <h4>xAI Grok</h4>

```python
from splitter_mr.model import GrokVisionModel

# Reads XAI_API_KEY (and optional XAI_MODEL) from .env
model = GrokVisionModel()
```

  <h4>Google Gemini</h4>

```python
from splitter_mr.model import GeminiVisionModel

# Requires GEMINI_API_KEY and the 'multimodal' extra installed
model = GeminiVisionModel()
```

  <h4>Anthropic (Claude Vision)</h4>

```python
from splitter_mr.model import AnthropicVisionModel

# Reads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (and optional ANTHROPIC_MODEL) from .env
model = AnthropicVisionModel()
```

  <h4>Hugging Face (local/open-source)</h4>

```python
from splitter_mr.model import HuggingFaceVisionModel

# Token only if the model requires gating
model = HuggingFaceVisionModel()
```

</details>



```python
from splitter_mr.model import AzureOpenAIVisionModel
from splitter_mr.reader import MarkItDownReader

file = "data/sample_pdf.pdf"
model = AzureOpenAIVisionModel()
```


Then, you can simply pass the model that you have instantiated to the Reader class:


```python
reader = MarkItDownReader(model=model)
output = reader.read(file)
```


This returns a `ReaderOutput` object with all document text and extracted image descriptions via the vision model. You can access metadata like `output.conversion_method`, `output.reader_method`, `output.ocr_method`, etc.

To retrieve the text content, you can simply access to the `text` attribute:


```python
print(output.text)
```

    A sample PDF
    
    Converting PDF files to other formats, such as Markdown, is a surprisingly
    complex task due to the nature of the PDF format itself. PDF (Portable
    Document Format) was designed primarily for preserving the visual layout of
    documents, making them look the same across different devices and
    platforms. However, this design goal introduces several challenges when trying to
    extract and convert the underlying content into a more flexible, structured format
    like Markdown.

    Conclusion
    
    While it may seem simple on the surface, converting PDFs to formats like
    Markdown involves a series of technical and interpretive challenges. Effective
    conversion tools must blend text extraction, document analysis, and sometimes
    machine learning techniques (such as OCR or structure recognition) to produce
    usable, readable, and faithful Markdown output. As a result, perfect conversion
    is rarely possible, and manual review and cleanup are often required.
    
    



With the by-default method, you obtain the text extracted from the PDF as it is shown. This method scan the PDF pages as images and process them using a VLM. The result will be a markdown text with all the images detected in every page. Every page is highlighted with a markdown comment as a placeholder: `<!-- page -->`. 

## Experimenting with some keyword arguments

In case that needed, you can pass use other keyword arguments to process the PDFs.

For example, you can customize how to process the images by the VLM using the parameter prompt. For example, in case that you only need an excerpt or a brief description for every page, you can use the following prompt:

```python
output = reader.read(
    file, 
    scan_pdf_pages = True, 
    prompt = "Return only a short description for these pages"
)
```


In case that needed, it could be interesting split the PDF pages using another placeholder. You can configure that using the `page_placeholder` parameter:


```python
output = reader.read(
    file,
    scan_pdf_pages=True,
    prompt="Return only a short description for these pages",
    page_placeholder="## PAGE",
)
print(output.text)
```

In comparison, `MarkItDownReader` offers a faster conversion than Docling but with less options to be configured. In that sense, we cannot obtain directly the `base64` images from every image detected in our documents, or write image placeholders easily (despite we can do it using a prompt). In addition, you will always get a `# Description` placeholder every time you use a VLM for extraction and captioning in this Reader. 

As conclusion, using this reader with a VLM can be useful for those use cases when we need to efficiently extract the text from a PDF. In case that you need the highest reliability or customization, it is not the most suitable option.
