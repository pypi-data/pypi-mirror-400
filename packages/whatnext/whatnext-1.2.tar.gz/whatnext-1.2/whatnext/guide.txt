Individual tasks use an expanded form of the GitHub style of task list:
    - [ ] open, this task is outstanding
    - [/] in progress, this task is partially complete
    - [X] complete, this task has been finished
    - [#] cancelled, this task has been abandoned
    - [<] blocked, this task needs more input

Tasks get prioritisation with emphasis on on the section or individual tasks:
    - [ ] _a singular important task_
    # **Most important tasks**
    - [ ] replace smoke alarm batteries

Files/sections use ```whatnext fence blocks to show notes in the task list.

Add @YYYY-MM-DD/2d to a task or section for deadlines. Without the modifier
tasks become imminent 2 weeks before the date, which raises the priority
above normal. Overdue tasks have the highest prioritisation.

Add @after to files, sections, or individual tasks to hide tasks until all
other tasks are complete, or include optional filename(s) to wait for a subset.
