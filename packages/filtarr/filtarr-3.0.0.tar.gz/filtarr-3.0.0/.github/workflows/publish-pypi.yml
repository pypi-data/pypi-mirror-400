name: Publish to PyPI (Manual)

# Manually triggered publish workflow.
# Automated publishing of new releases is handled by release-please.yml.
# Use this workflow only when you need to:
#   - Re-publish an existing, already-tagged release to TestPyPI/PyPI
#   - Perform a one-off publish outside the normal release-please flow
# Both workflows use the same pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish action.
