`pytest-revealtype-injector` is a `pytest` plugin for replacing [`reveal_type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.reveal_type) calls inside test functions as something more sophisticated. It does the following tasks in parallel:

- Launch external static type checkers and store `reveal_type` results.
- Use [`typeguard`](https://github.com/agronholm/typeguard) to verify the aforementioned static type checker result _really_ matches runtime code result.

## Usage

TL;DR:

1. Install this plugin
2. Install type checkers: `basedpyright`, `mypy`, `pyrefly`, `pyright`, `ty`
    - Disable any unwanted with `--revealtype-disable-adapter=<ADAPTER>` pytest CLI option
3. Create `pytest` functions which call `reveal_type()` with variable or function return result

### The longer story

This plugin would be automatically enabled when launching `pytest`.

For using `reveal_type()` inside tests, there is no boiler plate code involved. Import `reveal_type` normally, like:

```python
from typing import reveal_type
```

If you care about compatibility with older pythons, use:

```python
import sys
if sys.version >= (3, 11):
    from typing import reveal_type
else:
    from typing_extensions import reveal_type
```

Just importing `typing` (or `typing_extensions`) module is fine too:

```python
import typing

def test_something():
    x: str = 1  # type: ignore  # pyright: ignore
    typing.reveal_type(x)  # typeguard fails here
```

Since this plugin scans for `reveal_type()` for replacement under carpet, even `import ... as ...` syntax works:

```python
import typing as typ  # or...
from typing import reveal_type as rt
```

To supply config file specific for certain type checker, use `--revealtype-<ADAPTER>-config=<FILE>` pytest CLI option. For example, `--revealtype-pyrefly-config=tests/pyrefly.toml` instructs pyrefly to use `pyrefly.toml` under `tests` folder to override project root config.

### Limitations

There are 3 caveats.

1. This plugin only searches for global import in test files, so local import inside test function doesn't work. That means following code doesn't utilize this plugin at all:

```python
def test_something():
    from typing import reveal_type
    x = 1
    reveal_type(x)  # calls vanilla reveal_type()
```

2. `reveal_type()` calls have to stay within a single line, although you can use `reveal_type` result in assertion or other purpose:

```python
x = "1"
assert reveal_type(str(int(x))) == x
```

3. This plugin does not enlist any type checker as dependency, because any of them can be optionally disabled with pytest marker (see below) or command line option. It is up to application or library authors to include suitable type checker(s) as dependency themselves.

## Disable type checker with marker

Using [pytest marker](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/markers.html), it is possible to disable usage of certain type checker for specific test. All 3 types of markers (function, class and module level) are supported.

Function level:
```python
@pytest.mark.notypechecker("mypy")
def test_something(self) -> None:
    x = 1
    reveal_type(x)
```

Class level:
```python
@pytest.mark.notypechecker("pyright")
class TestSomething:
    def test_foo(self) -> None:
    ...
```

Module level:
```python
pytestmark = pytest.mark.notypechecker("basedpyright", "pyright")
```

Conversely, it is possible to only turn on usage of specific type checkers with `onlytypechecker` marker and exclude all others:

```python
@pytest.mark.onlytypechecker("mypy")
def test_for_mypy() -> None:
    ......
```

Note that disabling all type checkers is disallowed, and such tests would be treated as failure. Disable the `reveal_type()` call instead.

## Logging

This plugin uses standard [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) internally. `pytest -v` can be used to reveal `INFO` and `DEBUG` logs. Given following example:

```python
def test_superfluous(self) -> None:
    x: list[str] = ['a', 'b', 'c', 1]  # type: ignore  # pyright: ignore
    reveal_type(x)
```

Something like this will be shown as test result:

```
...
    raise TypeCheckError(f"is not an instance of {qualified_name(origin_type)}")
E   typeguard.TypeCheckError: item 3 is not an instance of str (from pyright)
------------------------------------------------------------- Captured log call -------------------------------------------------------------

```


## History

This pytest plugin starts its life as part of testsuite related utilities within [`types-lxml`](https://github.com/abelcheung/types-lxml). As `lxml` is a `cython` project and probably never incorporate inline python annotation in future, there is need to compare runtime result to static type checker output for discrepancy. As time goes by, it starts to make sense to manage as an independent project.

License-wise, originally it was part of `types-lxml` project, which is released under Apache-2.0 license. But as the sole author, it is at my own discretion to follow pytest
license (which is MIT) because this project is taking shape as a pytest plugin.
