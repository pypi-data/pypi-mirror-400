# config-reading

`config-reading` is a configuration reading extensibility point for your package via python entry-points mechanism.

## Features
- Bundled formats: TOML, YAML, JSON, Python
- Extensible via Python entry-points

## Installation
Install the core library:
```sh

```

To enable YAML support:

```

## Usage Example
```python
from config_reading import read_config

config1 = read_config('config.toml')
