# xrtm-forecast

Institutional-grade parallelized agentic reasoning engine.

## Overview
`xrtm-forecast` is an institutional-grade, domain-agnostic intelligence engine. It provides a framework for:
- **Inference Layer**: Standardized provider interfaces for Gemini and OpenAI.
- **Reasoning Graph**: A pluggable state-machine orchestrator for multi-agent workflows.
- **Agent Core**: Standardized `Agent` base class for structured reasoning and parsing.
- **Skill Protocol**: Composable behaviors (e.g., Search) that agents can dynamically equip.
- **Observability**: OTel-native structured telemetry and institutional execution reports.
- **Evaluation**: Built-in harness for backtesting and accuracy metrics (Brier Score).

## Architectural Design: "Engine vs. Specialists"

`xrtm-forecast` is designed for modularity using a "Lego" philosophy:
- **The Engine (`agents/`)**: Core structural bricks like `LLMAgent` and `ToolAgent`.
- **The Specialists (`agents/specialists/`)**: Pre-built expert roles like the `ForecastingAnalyst`.
- **The Registry**: A central exchange for discovering and plugging in agents and tools.

For a deep dive, see [Architecture & Design Principles](docs/architecture.md).

## Installation

### From PyPI (Stable)
```bash
pip install xrtm-forecast

# With extras (redis, memory)
pip install "xrtm-forecast[redis,memory]"
```

### From Source (Latest)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/xrtm-org/forecast.git
```

## Configuration

`xrtm-forecast` follows a decentralized configuration pattern. Global environment variables are used for infrastructure (API keys), while specific behaviors are controlled via module-level configuration classes.

### 1. Environment Secrets

Set your API keys in a `.env` file or environment:

```bash
# Core API Keys
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 2. Component Configuration

Each major module (`inference`, `graph`, `telemetry`, `tools`) has its own `config.py` defining its schema. This allows you to instantiate multiple components with different settings in the same process.

## Quick Start

`xrtm-forecast` is designed for high-end ergonomics. Use the pre-configured assistants to start forecasting in seconds:

```python
import asyncio
from forecast import create_forecasting_analyst

async def main():
    # 1. Instantiate the analyst with a shortcut
    # (API keys are automatically injected from your .env file)
    agent = create_forecasting_analyst(model_id="gemini")
    
    # 2. Execute reasoning on a complex probabilistic question
    result = await agent.run(
        "Will a general-purpose AI (AGI) be publicly announced before 2030?"
    )
    
    print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence * 100}%")
    print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
