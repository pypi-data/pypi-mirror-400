# skiptir

`skiptir` is a Python package to hyphenate Icelandic text.
Requires Python 3.9 or later.

## Installation

You can install `skiptir` via `pip`:

```bash
pip install skiptir
```

## Usage

```python
from skiptir import hyphenate

hyphenate("Þetta er íslensk setning.", hyphen="-")
'Þetta er ís-lensk setn-ing.'
```

Command line tool usage:

```bash
skiptir [--mode MODE] [--hyphen HYPHEN]
```

The tool reads text from standard input and prints the
hyphenated result to standard output, e.g.:

```bash
echo "Þetta er íslensk setning." | skiptir --hyphen "-"
Þetta er ís-lensk setn-ing.
```

MODE is `pattern` by default, which means using Pyphen
with the latest Icelandic hyphenation patterns.
Other modes are not supported yet.

HYPHEN refers to a custom hyphenation character, e.g. `·` or `-`.
By default, `skiptir` uses the invisible soft hyphen character (`U+00AD`).
