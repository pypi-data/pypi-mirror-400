    "## Preparation\n",
    "First, please install  `pyxccd`. In a Jupyter notebook cell, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pyxccd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you need to install the visualization package:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install seaborn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the recent source codes of [pyxccd](https://github.com/Remote-Sensing-of-Land-Resource-Lab/pyxccd) in the devel branch, unzipped it, and under the directory `/pyxccd/tutorial`, the directory should look like: <br />\n",

    "(1) The tutorial primarily provides pixel-based time series examples for educational purposes; however, in practical applications, analyses are typically performed on image-based datasets. In Lesson 4, we will specifically demonstrate the procedures for applying pyxccd to real-world image-based time series;\n",

    "(2) All date columns in the tutorial are formatted as Gregorian proleptic ordinal numbers, representing the number of days elapsed since 0001-01-01. Users can convert the ordinal date format to human-readable date format using the Python function `datetime.date.fromordinal()`.\n",
