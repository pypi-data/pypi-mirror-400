# Semantic API

#### Versions

```0.0.35``` : query_result method added to query_object
```0.0.34``` : query.py added to support the simplified query API



### Install

```pip3 install semantic-api```

### Use

#### Import
```
from semantic.api.semantic_api import semantic
from semantic.common.utils import defineSchemaId
from semantic.api.config import brokerIP, dbUri, batch_size
```


#### Schema context configuration

An ontology is assumed to built from a set of ontology clusters and identified by a ```schemaName```, and a ```schemaVersion```.

This ```schemaName-schemaVersion``` pair defines a schema instance in the database which is further identified by ```instanceName``` since it is common  practice to have multiple logical instances in the database for the same ontology.

The function ```defineSchemaId(schemaName, schemaVersion, instanceName, dbUri)``` from ```semantic.common.utils```defines and instance of the type ```SchemaID``` that is used to bind with the semantic context in the database. 

The extra ```dbUri``` parameter provides the domain information of the schema and data and the ```JSON-LD``` ```@context``` that is returned in queries.

The Semantic API shall be instantiated before using api.narration or api.chain methods as these require a connection to the MQTT broker. Note that a database with the ```schemaName-schemaVersion-instanceName``` is assumed to be running along with a semantic service (out of scope of this project).

```
api = semantic( brokerIp, defineSchemaId(schemaName, schemaVersion, instanceName, dbUri), batch_size)
```

| Parameter | Use | Suggestion |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| brokerIP | MQTT Broker IP | use remote broker for project, default from config is 'localhost' |
| schemaName | identifying name for schema | according to defined schemas |
| schemaVersion | schema version | according to defined schemas|
| instanceName | database instance for schemaName-schemaVersion | suggest user defined instance assuming this has been created and instantiated with schema |
| dbUri | db IP:port URI | use default from config defined as 'http://127.0.0.1:6363/'|
                                      

#### Database client

The API supports a lower level database client ```semantic.client```that is useful for database configuration tasks. Currently, only two methods are exposed on ```client``` but will be filled out and adequately documented to match the current service API. A commnand line version of this client libary will also be provided as the command line is more useful for maintenance than programtic use, as per the current node.js based semantic-client.


| semantic.client methods | return |
|:--- |:--- |
| ```getSchemaId()``` |  ```SchemaID``` instance in service |
| ```setSchemaId(schemaName, schemaVersion, instanceName)``` | sets ```SchemaId``` instance (assumning current ```dBUri```)|
