          # use the device in a with statement
          with self.get_device() as camera:
              camera.do_something()



   .. py:method:: open() -> Any

      :param merge: If ``True``, the new dict is recursively merged with the current set config dict. If ``False`` the

   .. py:method:: get_configuration() -> dict

      Get the currently active configuration.

      :returns: The currently active configuration.



   .. py:method:: configure(config: str = '', metadata: dict | None = None) -> bool

      Configure the device with the known configuration `config`.

      To add a configuration to the device, use :meth:`update_configuration`.

      :param config: Key (name) of the configuration
      :param metadata: Metadata that is merged into the current payload metadata dict which is send with every emitted
                       :code:`acquisition_data` event.



   .. py:attribute:: set_configuration


   .. py:method:: update_payload_metadata(metadata: dict, merge: bool = True) -> None

      Update metadata dict send with every emitted frame by the :code:`acquisition_data` event method.

      :param metadata: Metadata that is merged into the current payload metadata dict which is send with every emitted
                       :code:`acquisition_data` event.
      :param merge: If ``True``, the new dict is merged with the current set metadata dict. If ``False`` the old
                    metadata is overwritten by the given dict.



   .. py:method:: arm(metadata: dict | None = None, kill_running: bool = False) -> bool

      Arm the device with the currently active configuration.

      :param metadata: Metadata that is merged into the current payload metadata dict which is send with every emitted
                       :code:`acquisition_data` event.
      :param kill_running: If ``True`` any running acquisition will be stopped. If ``False`` and an acquisition is
      :param already running:
      :param an error will be raised.:

      :returns: True if arming was successful else False



   .. py:method:: acquisition_data(frame: numpy.ndarray, metadata: dict | None = None) -> tuple

      Event to emit new frames.

      .. note::
          The dtype of the frame is not changed here.

      :param frame: The frame payload data (for example an image or an scope trace)
      :param metadata: The metadata which is passed along the payload. This argument takes precedence over the
                       :code:`payload_metadata` attribute (for example set by the :code:`update_payload_metadata` method)
                       while merging the two dicts.

      :returns: A tuple of image and metadata(-dict)



   .. py:method:: acquisition_started(metadata: dict | None = None) -> dict

      Event emitted when the acquisition thread starts.

      :returns: A dict with acquisition metadata



   .. py:method:: acquisition_stopped(metadata: dict | None = None) -> dict

      Event emitted when the acquisition thread stops.

      :returns: A dict with acquisition metadata
