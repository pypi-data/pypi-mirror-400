If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
        
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions.
        
        Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
        
        Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability.
        
        In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
        
        While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# B2AI Prep

A simple Python package to prepare acoustic data for the Bridge2AI voice project.

**Caution:** this package is under active development and interfaces may change rapidly.

## Installation

Requires a Python >= 3.10; < 3.14 environment.

```
pip install b2aiprep
```

## Common Issues

If you get the following error which has been observed on only some OSes:

```python
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc
Aborted (core dumped)
```

A likely fix is to run `pip uninstall torbi`.

## Usage

See commands available through the CLI:

```bash
b2aiprep-cli --help
```

## BIDS data

This package provides conversion from a RedCap/file-based custom structure into [BIDS](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/folders_and_files/folders.html) for downstream analysis. In addition, utilities are provided for working with the BIDS-like structured data and to support data analysis of voice and questionnaire data.

See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for details on releasing a dataset using this package.

See the [tutorial.ipynb](docs/tutorial.ipynb) for a few use examples of data in the BIDS format.

### Output formats

The primary output structure is BIDS: nested sessions within individual specific folders.

```

│  ...
```

A bundled version of the data is published from BIDS. The bundled version of the dataset contains parquet files with features derived from the audio.
