# xarray

There are two functions for working with XArray Datasets, one for converting
a CDF to a DataSet, and one for going the other way. To use these you need
the ``xarray`` package installed.

These will attempt to determine any
[ISTP Compliance](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp_guide/istp_guide.html), and incorporate that into the output.
