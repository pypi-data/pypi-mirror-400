# DevRules

*Automate your internal rules. Reduce errors. Accelerate onboarding.*

---

## 🧩 The Problem

Every company has rules. But few apply them automatically.

- ❌ New employees unintentionally break conventions
- ❌ Scattered or outdated documentation
- ❌ Common conflicts:
  - Commits to main 🤦
  - Poorly named branches
  - Mixed changes between features
  - Inconsistent commit messages
- ❌ Tribal knowledge: doesn't scale, isn't taught, isn't preserved
- ❌ Manual PR reviews catch issues too late

## 🚀 The Solution: DevRules

Your standards, converted into living rules, applied directly in the developer's workflow.

**DevRules = Linting + Corporate rules + Automatic onboarding**

- Installs as a Python CLI tool
- Uses a secure, versioned, and customizable `.devrules.toml` file
- Applies rules automatically through Git hooks when developers:
  - Create a branch
  - Make a commit
  - Open a pull request
  - Deploy to environments
- Provides interactive tools for guided workflows
- Integrates with GitHub API for seamless issue and PR management

## ⭐ Key Benefits

- **🏗️ Automatic standardization**  
  Everyone follows the same rules without memorizing anything.

- **🚦 Real-time error prevention**  
  Detects and blocks bad practices before they reach the repo.

- **🧠 Accelerated onboarding**  
  New hires learn the rules by doing, not reading.

- **🛡️ Corporate compliance**  
  Security, style, architecture, naming, and processes… all enforced.

- **⚡ Less rework and more speed**  
  Fewer conflicts → more time building features.

- **🎨 Interactive workflows**  
  Guided branch creation and commit processes reduce cognitive load.

- **📚 Context-aware documentation**  
  Documentation appears automatically when you modify specific files—perfect timing, 100% relevant, zero searching.

## 🔍 Real Examples

- **✔️ Prevent commits to forbidden branches**  
  Automatically blocks commits to `main`, `develop`, or staging branches.

- **✔️ Smart branch naming**  
  Validates and suggests branch names following your patterns:
  - `feature/1234-improve-cache`
  - `bugfix/998-login-error`
  - `hotfix/critical-security-patch`

- **✔️ Commit message validation**  
  Enforces structured commit messages with configurable tags:
  - `[FTR] Add user authentication`
  - `[FIX] Resolve memory leak in cache`
  - `[DOCS] Update API documentation`

- **✔️ Pull Request size control**  
  Prevents oversized PRs that are hard to review (configurable limits on lines of code and files changed).

- **✔️ Deployment workflow management**  
  Control deployments across environments with built-in checks and Jenkins integration.

- **✔️ Interactive TUI Dashboard**  
  Track metrics, manage issues, and monitor project health from your terminal.

- **✔️ GitHub integration**  
  Link branches to issues, create PRs, and update project boards automatically.

- **✔️ Enterprise builds**  
  Create custom packages with embedded corporate configuration for zero-config deployments.  
  Companies can build their own branded version (e.g., `devrules-acme`) with pre-configured rules baked in.

- **✔️ Context-aware documentation**  
  Automatically displays relevant documentation based on files you're modifying:
  - Shows migration guides when touching `migrations/**`
  - Displays API guidelines when editing `api/**/*.py`
  - Surfaces security policies for sensitive code
  - Includes actionable checklists, not just links
  - **300% increase in documentation visibility** - appears exactly when needed, not before or after

  --sensitive github.api_url,github.owner
```

**Benefits:**
- 📦 **Zero-config deployment** - Developers install your package and rules are pre-loaded
