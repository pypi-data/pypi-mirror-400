VCF VALIDATION RESULTS
Checks whether each file is compliant with the VCF specification (http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.4.pdf).
Also checks whether the variants' reference alleles match against the reference assembly.
    input_fail.vcf
		❌ Assembly check: 26/36 (72.22%)
		First 10 errors per category are below. Full report: /path/to/assembly_failed/report
			Parsing error: The assembly checking could not be completed: Contig 'chr23' not found in assembly report
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35549, reference allele 'G' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'c'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35595, reference allele 'G' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'a'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35618, reference allele 'G' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'c'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35626, reference allele 'A' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'g'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35639, reference allele 'T' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'c'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35643, reference allele 'T' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'g'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35717, reference allele 'T' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'g'

			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35822, reference allele 'T' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'c'
		❌ VCF check: 1 critical errors, 1 non-critical errors
		First 10 errors per category are below. Full report: /path/to/vcf_failed/report
			Critical error: Line 4: Error in meta-data section.
			Non-critical error: Sample #11, field AD does not match the meta specification Number=R (expected 2 value(s)). AD=..
    input_passed.vcf

SAMPLE NAME CONCORDANCE CHECK
Checks whether information in the metadata is concordant with that contained in the VCF files, in particular sample names.
	❌ Analysis A: Sample names in metadata do not match with those in VCF files
		First 10 errors per category are below. Full report: /path/to/sample/report
			Samples described in the metadata but not in the VCF files:  SampleA1, SampleA2 , SampleA3, SampleA4, SampleA5, SampleA6, SampleA7, SampleA8, SampleA9, SampleA10

REFERENCE GENOME INSDC CHECK
Checks that the reference sequences in the FASTA file used to call the variants are accessioned in INSDC.
Also checks if the reference assembly accession in the metadata matches the one determined from the FASTA file.
    metadata_asm_match.fa
		✔ All sequences are INSDC accessioned.
		✔ Analysis A: Assembly accession in metadata is compatible
    metadata_asm_not_found.fa
		✔ All sequences are INSDC accessioned.
		❌ No assembly accession found in metadata
			Full report: /path/to/metadata_asm_not_found.yml
			Assembly accession found in metadata: Not found
			Assembly accession(s) compatible with FASTA: GCA_1
    metadata_asm_not_gca.fa
        Warning: Non-GCA reference found in metadata. Please provide the INSDC accession for your reference assembly.
        If you would like to submit using a non-GCA reference sequence, contact eva-helpdesk@ebi.ac.uk.
		✔ All sequences are INSDC accessioned.
		❗ Analysis B: Assembly accession in metadata is not compatible
			Full report: /path/to/metadata_asm_not_gca.yml
			Assembly accession found in metadata: GCF_1
			Assembly accession(s) compatible with FASTA: GCA_1
    metadata_asm_not_match.fa
		✔ All sequences are INSDC accessioned.
		❗ Analysis B: Assembly accession in metadata is not compatible
