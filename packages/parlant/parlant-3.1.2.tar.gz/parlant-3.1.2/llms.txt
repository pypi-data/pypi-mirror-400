# Parlant

> Open-source AI agent framework for building customer-facing conversational agents with ensured rule compliance and enterprise-grade behavior control.

Parlant is a Python framework for building **predictable, business-aligned AI agents**. Unlike prompt-based approaches, Parlant ensures agents follow behavioral rules through structured guideline matching and contextual application.

Install: `pip install parlant`

## Quick Start Example

```python
import parlant.sdk as p
import asyncio

@p.tool
async def get_account_balance(context: p.ToolContext, account_id: str) -> p.ToolResult:
    # Your business logic here
    balance = 1234.56
    return p.ToolResult(data={"balance": balance, "currency": "USD"})

async def main() -> None:
    async with p.Server() as server:
        agent = await server.create_agent(
            name="Banking Assistant",
            description="Helpful and professional banking support agent",
        )

        # Add behavioral guidelines
        await agent.create_guideline(
            condition="The customer asks about their balance",
            action="Retrieve and clearly present their account balance",
            tools=[get_account_balance],
        )

        await agent.create_guideline(
            condition="The customer asks about topics unrelated to banking",
            action="Politely decline and redirect to banking topics",
        )

        # Server runs until shutdown - no additional code needed here.
        # When the process exits, the context manager handles cleanup automatically.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run with: `python your_agent.py` then open http://localhost:8800

## Core Concepts

### 1. Agents
AI personalities that interact with customers. Created via `server.create_agent()`.

Learn more: [Agents Documentation](https://parlant.io/docs/concepts/agents)

### 2. Guidelines
Natural language if-then rules that control agent behavior contextually:
```python
await agent.create_guideline(
    condition="When this situation occurs",  # The trigger
    action="Do this specific thing",          # The response behavior
    tools=[optional_tool],                    # Tools available for this guideline
)
```

Learn more: [Guidelines Documentation](https://parlant.io/docs/concepts/customization/guidelines)

### 3. Journeys
Structured multi-step interaction flows (state machines):
```python
journey = await agent.create_journey(
    title="Order Support",
    description="Helps customers with order issues",
    conditions=["The customer has an order-related question"],
)

# Chain states with transitions
t0 = await journey.initial_state.transition_to(chat_state="Ask for order number")
t1 = await t0.target.transition_to(tool_state=lookup_order)
t2 = await t1.target.transition_to(
    chat_state="Present order status",
    condition="Order was found",
)
await t2.target.transition_to(state=p.END_JOURNEY)
```

Learn more: [Journeys Documentation](https://parlant.io/docs/concepts/customization/journeys)

### 4. Tools
Functions the agent can call. Always async, always return `ToolResult`:
```python
@p.tool
async def my_tool(
    context: p.ToolContext,      # Always first param
    required_param: str,          # Required parameters
    optional_param: int = 10,     # Optional with defaults
) -> p.ToolResult:
    # Business logic here
    return p.ToolResult(data={"key": "value"})
```

Learn more: [Tools Documentation](https://parlant.io/docs/concepts/customization/tools)

### 5. Glossary Terms
Teach agents domain-specific terminology:
```python
await agent.create_term(
    name="SKU",
    description="Stock Keeping Unit - unique product identifier",
    synonyms=["product code", "item number"],
)
```

Learn more: [Glossary Documentation](https://parlant.io/docs/concepts/customization/glossary)

### 6. Canned Responses
Template responses to eliminate hallucination and control language style:
```python
await agent.add_canned_response(
    key="greeting",
    content="Hello! I'm here to help with your order. How can I assist you today?",
)
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Tool with Customer Context
```python
@p.tool
async def get_customer_orders(context: p.ToolContext) -> p.ToolResult:
    # context.customer_id is automatically available
    orders = await db.get_orders(context.customer_id)
    return p.ToolResult(data=orders)
```

### Pattern: Conditional Transitions
```python
# Branch based on conditions
t0 = await journey.initial_state.transition_to(tool_state=check_eligibility)

# Multiple outgoing transitions from same state
await t0.target.transition_to(
    chat_state="Approve the request",
    condition="Customer is eligible",
)
await t0.target.transition_to(
    chat_state="Explain why they're not eligible",
    condition="Customer is not eligible",
)
```

### Pattern: Disambiguation
Handle ambiguous user intents:
```python
observation = await agent.create_observation(
    "The customer mentions a problem but doesn't specify what kind",
)
await observation.disambiguate([billing_journey, technical_support_journey])
```

### Pattern: Journey-Scoped Guidelines
Guidelines that only apply within a specific journey:
```python
await journey.create_guideline(
    condition="Customer seems frustrated",
    action="Acknowledge their frustration and offer to escalate",
)
```
