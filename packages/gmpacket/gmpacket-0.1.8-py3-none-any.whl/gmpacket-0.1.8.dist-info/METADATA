# Description of GMP —A GeoJSON Specification for Ground Motion Metrics

Here we present a specification for a GeoJSON (https://geojson.org/) format for 
unassociated and event-associated ground motion metrics—that is, quantities 
derived from ground motion records (e.g., accelerograms, velocity recordings). 
We refer to this specification as a Ground Motion Packet (GMP). Common example 
metrics include peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), and 
spectral acceleration (SA). This format is designed so that it can also include 
metrics that are gaining popularity for many engineering use cases, such as 
significant duration, Arias intensity, and inelastic response spectra. This 
format should be able to be used by any application that uses ground motion 
metrics including, but not limited to, ShakeMap. The GMP format is not meant to 
describe station metadata or site installation. The purpose of the metadata 
included in the GMP format is to provide high-level information regarding the 
suitability of the data for common engineering/seismological applications.
