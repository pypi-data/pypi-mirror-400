    Source: problem 155 (p. 88) in
    A.R. Buckley,
    "Test functions for unconstrained minimization",
    TR 1989CS-3, Mathematics, statistics and computing centre,

    SIF input: Ph. Toint, Dec 1989.
    Least-squares version of RECIPE.SIF, Nick Gould, Jan 2020.

    Classification: SUR2-AY-3-0

    This is the least-squares version of RECIPE, minimizing:
    (X1 - 5)² + (X2²)² + (X3/(X2-X1))²

    TODO: Human review needed
    Issue: Test timeouts on 3-variable problem despite simple structure
    Note: RECIPE (nonlinear equations version) works correctly, but this
          least-squares version times out unexpectedly. Suspect JAX compilation
          or gradient computation issue with the division term.
