    """Copy an item into this collection

    Copy an item from a local or remote source into this collection.

    user creating the copy must have read access to the source
    item. The new item name can be specified, along with the
    destination folder; all other metadata changes must be done
    once the item copy is complete.

    All item types support being copied:

    * Copied file and dataviews will share the same
      delfini+datastore:// target, preventing a duplicate copy of
      the data from being stored in the datastore. Copies will not
      affect each other, though, as all writes to file items
      result in a new delfini+datastore:// URL.

    * Links will copy their storage target URLs, and no data will
      be copied.

    * Folders can be copied, however, their contents are not
      recursively copied. To copy an entire folder structure,
      clients should follow a recursive breadth-first algorithm to
      copy the folder, followed by its contents.

    * Dataviews can be copied, however, their data sources will
      not automatically map to new data sources if they are copied
      to a new collection. Clients should assist users to remap
      dataview sources if/when those sources are broken.
