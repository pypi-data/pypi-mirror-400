# HEA Server Organization
[Research Informatics Shared Resource](https://risr.hci.utah.edu), [Huntsman Cancer Institute](https://hci.utah.edu),
Salt Lake City, UT

The HEA Server Organization is a service for managing organization information for research laboratories and other research groups.


## Version 1.13.0
* Bumped heaserver version to 1.49.0.
* Allow filtering organization lookups by organization attributes.
* Fixed /organizations/.../accounts endpoint to accept heaobject.account.AccountView ids rather than AWS-specific ids.

## Version 1.12.1
* Reject new and updated organizations with accounts that overlap with existing organizations.

## Version 1.12.0
* Bumped heaserver version to 1.48.0.
* Added support for encrypted Mongo and RabbitMQ passwords.

## Version 1.11.0
* Bumped heaserver version to 1.45.1.
* New startup.py module to initialize logging before importing any third-party libraries.
* New optional -e/--env command-line argument for setting the runtime environment (development, staging, or
  production). Logging is now configured based on this setting, unless the older -l/--logging argument is provided. The
  default value is development.
* Logs are now scrubbed.
* Added log files to .gitignore.

## Version 1.10.10
* Fixed an issue where updating an organization caused the organization to acquire collaborators from another
  organization.

## Version 1.10.9
* Log when this service receives a collaborator update message.

## Version 1.10.8
* Improved reliability of changing organization user access.
* Improved reliability of getting an organization's volumes.

## Version 1.10.7
* Removed old collaborator_ids attribute from member card template.
* Bumped heaserver version to 1.43.3.

## Version 1.10.6
* Bumped heaserver version to 1.43.0.
* Updated collaborator changing code for changes to Volume attributes.

## Version 1.10.5
* Bumped heaserver version to 1.41.2 to address issue getting AWS account-level collaborator info.

## Version 1.10.4
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.31.2 to address bug deleting collaborator info. The legacy collaborator info held no
  account information, which made accurately tracking collaborators with access to multiple accounts in an
  organization impossible. Now that the heaobject.organization.Organization class associates an account with each
  collaboration record, this is fixed, but handling of legacy data without the account information remains imperfect.
  In particular, if this microservice receives a collaborator removal event from the message broker, and there is
  a legacy collaboration record for that user, the legacy record will be deleted even though the user may still have
  collaborator access to the organizations' other accounts. New collaborator records will be correctly added and
  removed. For now, if you believe the organization's listing of collaborators is incorrect due to legacy collaborator
  information, use the account properties for a full accounting of users with collaborator access to it. This remaining
  issue with legacy data will be resolved in a future release.

## Version 1.10.3
* Bumped heaobject version to 1.31.1 to address bug deleting legacy collaborator info.

## Version 1.10.2
* Prevent "All collaborators must be removed from an account before removing it from the organization" error when
  updating an organization with collaborators with no associated account.

## Version 1.10.1
* Write a type property for organization collaborators in the organization properties template.

## Version 1.10.0
* Bumped heaserver version to 1.41.1.
* Added new collaborator info to endpoints.

## Version 1.9.2
* Bumped heaserver to 1.37.1.

## Version 1.9.1
* Bumped heaserver to 1.36.2.

## Version 1.9.0
* Bumped heaserver to 1.35.0.
* Use new sort logic from heaserver 1.35.
* Added sort-related query parameters to OpenAPI specs.
* Fixed import statements in run-swaggerui.py.

## Version 1.8.1
* Bumped heaserver version to 1.32.2 to correct a potential issue causing the microservice to fail to send messages to
  the message broker.

## Version 1.8.0
* We now mark organizations with the new hea-container and hea-self-container rel values.
* Renamed the organizations/{id}/awsaccounts endpoint organizations/{id}/accounts, since that's what it was actually
  doing, and organizations are agnostic of the account type. The link from organization to account was updated to
  reflect this change.

## Version 1.7.2
* Bumped heaserver version to 1.30.0.
* Removed duplicate user_shares and group_shares fields in the organization property metadata.

## Version 1.7.1
* Bumped heaserver version to 1.28.1.

## Version 1.7.0
* Added group permissions support.

## Version 1.6.2
* Call the correct URL for removing a user from a group.

## Version 1.6.1
* new links for org collection+json

## Version 1.6.0
* New /organizations/{id}/recentlyaccessed endpoint.

## Version 1.5.5
* Added support for python 3.12.

## Version 1.5.4
* Fixed potential hang when listing an organization's accounts.

## Version 1.5.3
* No user-visible changes. Updated to interoperate with heaserver-keychain 1.5.0.

## Version 1.5.2
* Caching optimizations.

## Version 1.5.1
* Invalidate cache when receiving collaborator changes from the message queue.

## Version 1.5.0
* Added collaborator_ids attribute. The collaborator_ids attribute is altered via message queue messages.

## Version 1.4.9
* Attempt to relink Credentials objects with their corresponding Volumes when saving an Organization.

## Version 1.4.8
* Handle case where user who is an organization admin, manager, member, or PI has been deleted from keycloak.
* Omit system users from the membership editor form.

## Version 1.4.7
* Fixed issue causing volumes and credentials for a new PI not to be created.

## Version 1.4.6
* Fixed issue creating new credentials objects without a role when a user is added to an organization.

## Version 1.4.5
* Fixed crash when reusing an existing volume and credentials when a user's organization membership has changed.

## Version 1.4.4
* Return 400 status code when the user lacks permission to update permissions for an organization (those errors were ignored previously).
* Corrected permissions checking for organization managers and members.

## Version 1.4.3
* Send the account ids and group id fields when submitting the members editor form.

## Version 1.4.2
* Corrected heaobject.organization.Organization permissions.

## Version 1.4.1
* Generate the correct name attribute for heaobject.keychain.AWSCredentials objects.

## Version 1.4.0
* Changing organization members, managers, admins, and PI now changes the users' volumes and credentials objects to
match.
* The admin, manager, and member lists now omit system users.

## Version 1.3.0
* Display type display name in properties card, and return the type display name from GET calls.

## Version 1.2.0
* Improved performance accessing an organization's AWS accounts.
* heaobject.organization.Organization objects now have an accounts attribute that mirrors the contents of the existing
aws_account_ids attribute and will support other heaobject.account.Account subclasses in the future.

## Version 1.1.0
* Pass desktop object permissions back to clients.

## Version 1.0.2
* Improved performance.

## Version 1.0.1
* Improved performance.

## Version 1
Initial release.

## Runtime requirements
* Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12.

## Development environment

### Build requirements
* Any development environment is fine.
* On Windows, you also will need:
    * Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019, found at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/. Select the C++ tools.
    * git, found at https://git-scm.com/download/win.
* On Mac, Xcode or the command line developer tools is required, found in the Apple Store app.
* Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12: Download and install Python from https://www.python.org, and select the options to install
for all users and add Python to your environment variables. The install for all users option will help keep you from
accidentally installing packages into your Python installation's site-packages directory instead of to your virtualenv
environment, described below.
* Create a virtualenv environment using the `python -m venv <venv_directory>` command, substituting `<venv_directory>`
with the directory name of your virtual environment. Run `source <venv_directory>/bin/activate` (or `<venv_directory>/Scripts/activate` on Windows) to activate the virtual
environment. You will need to activate the virtualenv every time before starting work, or your IDE may be able to do
this for you automatically. **Note that PyCharm will do this for you, but you have to create a new Terminal panel
after you newly configure a project with your virtualenv.**
* From the project's root directory, and using the activated virtualenv, run
  `pip install -r requirements_dev.txt`. **Do NOT run `python setup.py develop`. It will break your environment.**

### Running tests
Run tests with the `pytest` command from the project root directory. To improve performance, run tests in multiple
processes with `pytest -n auto`.

### Running integration tests
* Install Docker
* On Windows, install pywin32 version >= 223 from https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases. In your venv, make sure that
`include-system-site-packages` is set to `true`.

### Trying out the APIs
This microservice has Swagger3/OpenAPI support so that you can quickly test the APIs in a web browser. Do the following:
* Install Docker, if it is not installed already.
* Run the `run-swaggerui.py` file in your terminal. This file contains some test objects that are loaded into a MongoDB
  Docker container.
* Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs` in your web browser.

Once `run-swaggerui.py` is running, you can also access the APIs via `curl` or other tool. For example, in Windows
PowerShell, execute:
```
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8080/organizations/ -Method GET -Headers @{'accept' = 'application/json'}`
```
In MacOS or Linux, the equivalent command is:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/organizations/ -H 'accept: application/json'
```
