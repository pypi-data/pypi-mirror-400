def combine_factors(factors: Union[dict, Sequence, biocutils.NamedList, biocframe.BiocFrame], keep_unused: bool = False) -> biocutils.NamedList:
    """Combine multiple categorical factors based on the unique combinations of levels from each factor.

    Args:
        factors:
            Sequence of factors of interest.
            Each entry corresponds to a factor and should be a sequence of the same length.
            Corresponding elements across all factors represent the combination of levels for a single observation.

            Alternatively, a dictionary where each entry corresponds to a factor.
            Each key is the name of the factor and value is a sequence containing the factor.

            Alternatively, a :py:class:`~biocutils.NamedList.NamedList` where each entry is a factor.
            This may or may not be named.

            Alternatively, a :py:class:`~biocframe.BiocFrame.BiocFrame` where each column is a factor.

        keep_unused:
            Whether to report unused combinations of levels.
            If any entry of ``factors`` is a :py:class:`~biocutils.Factor.Factor` object, any unused levels will also be preserved.

    Returns:
        :py:class:`~biocutils.NamedList.NamedList` containing the following entries.

        - ``levels``: a :py:class:`~biocframe.BiocFrame.BiocFrame` containing the sorted and unique combinations of levels as a tuple.
          Each column corresponds to a factor in ``factors`` while each row represents a unique combination.
          Corresponding elements of each column define a single combination, i.e., the ``i``-th combination is defined by taking the ``i``-th element of each column.
        - ``index``: an integer NumPy array specifying the index into ``levels`` for each observation.

        For observation ``i`` and factor ``j``, ``levels[j][index[i]]`` will recover ``factors[j][i]``.
