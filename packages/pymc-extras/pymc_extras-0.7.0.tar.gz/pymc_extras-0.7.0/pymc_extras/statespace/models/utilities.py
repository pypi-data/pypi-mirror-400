    -------
    T, ndarray
        The transition matrix associated with a SARIMA model of order (p,d,q)x(P,D,Q,S)

    Notes
    -----
    The transition matrix for the SARIMA model has a bunch of structure in it, especially when differences are included
    in the statespace model. This function will always assume the state space matrix is in the Harvey representation.

    Given this representation, the matrix can be divided into a bottom part and a top part. The top part has (S * D) + d
    rows, and is associated with the differencing operations. The bottom part has max(P*S+p, Q*S+q+1) rows, and is
    responsible for the actual time series dynamics.

    The bottom part of the matrix is quite simple, it is just a shifted identity matrix (called a "companion matrix"),
    responsible for "rolling" the states, so that at each transition, the value for :math:`x_{t-3}` becomes the value
    for :math:`x_{t-2}`, and so on.

    The top part is quite complex. The goal of this part of the matrix is to transform the raw data state, :math:`x_t`,
    into a stationary state, :math:`x_t^\star`, via the application of differencing operations,
    :math:`\Delta x_t = x_t - x_{t-1}`. For ARIMA differences (the little ``d``), this is quite simple. Sequential
    differences are representated as an upper-triangular matrix of ones. To see this, consider an example where ``d=3``,
    so that:
     .. math::

        \begin{align}
            x_t^\star &= \Delta^3 x_t \\
             &= \Delta^2 (x_t - x_{t-1})
             &= \Delta (x_t - 2x_{t-1} + x_{t-2})
             &= x_t - x_{t-1} - 2x_{t-1} + 2x_{t-3} + x_{t-2} - x_{t-3}
             &= x_t - 3x_{t-1} + 3x_{t-3} - x_{t-3}
        \end{align}

    If you choose a state vector :math:`\begin{bmatrix}x_t & \Delta x_t & \Delta^2 x_t & x_t^\star \end{bmatrix}^T`,
    you will find that:

    .. math::
        \begin{bmatrix}x_t \\ \Delta x_t \\ \Delta^2 x_t \\ x_t^\star \end{bmatrix} =
            \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
                            0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
                            0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
                            0 & 0 & 0 & 1
            \end{bmatrix}
            \begin{bmatrix} x_{t-1} \\ \Delta x_{t-1} \\ \Delta^2 x_{t-1} \\ x_{t-1}^\star \end{bmatrix}

    Next are the seasonal differences. The highest seasonal difference stored in the states is one less than the
    seasonal difference order, ``D``. That is, if ``D = 1, S = 4``, there will be states :math:``x_{t-1}, x_{t-2},
    x_{t-3}, x_{t-4}, x_t^\star`, with :math:`x_t^\star = \Delta_4 x_t = x_t - x_{t-4}`. The level state can be
    recovered by adding :math:`x_t^\star + x_{t-4}`. To accomplish all of this, two things need to be inserted into the
    transition matrix:

        1. A shifted identity matrix to "roll" the lagged states forward each transition, and
        2. A pair of 1's to recover the level state by adding the last 2 states (:math:`x_t^\star + x_{t-4}`)

    Keeping the example of ``D = 1, S = 4``, the block that handles the seasonal difference will look this this:
    .. math::
        \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
                        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}

    In the presence of higher order seasonal differences, there needs to be one block per difference. And the level
    state is recovered by adding together the last state from each block. For example, if ``D = 2, S = 4``, the states
    will be :math:`x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, x_{t-3}, x_{t-4}, \Delta_4 x_{t-1}, \Delta_4 x_{t-2}, \Delta_4 x_{t-3},
    \Delta_4 x_{t-4} x_t^\star`, with :math:`x_t^\star = \Delta_4^2 = \Delta_4(x_t - x_{t-4}) = x_t - 2 x_{t-4} +
    x_{t-8}`. To recover the level state, we need :math:`x_t = x_t^\star + \Delta_4 x_{t-4} + x_{t-4}`. In addition,
    to recover :math:`\Delta_4 x_t`, we have to compute :math:`\Delta_4 x_t = x_t^\star + \Delta_4 x_{t-4} =
    \Delta_4(x_t - x_{t-4}) + \Delta_4 x_{t-4} = \Delta_4 x_t`. The block of the transition matrix associated with all
    this is thus:

    .. math::
        \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
                        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}

    When ARIMA differences and seasonal differences are mixed, the seasonal differences will be written in terms of the
    highest ARIMA difference order, and recovery of the level state will require the use of all the ARIMA differences,
    as well as the seasonal differences. In addition, the seasonal differences are needed to back out the ARIMA
    differences from :math:`x_t^\star`. Here is the differencing block for a SARIMA(0,2,0)x(0,2,0,4) -- the identites
    of the states is left an exercise for the motivated reader:

    .. math::
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
            0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
            0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

    axes. In this case, reordering is done jointly on all axes -- it does *not* use fancy indexing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: TensorVariable
        Input tensor
    labels: list of str
        Labels associated with values of the input tensor ``x``, along the ``labeled_axis``. At runtime, should have
        ``x.shape[labeled_axis] == len(labels)``. If ``labeled_axis`` is a tuple, all axes are assumed to have the
        same labels.
    ordered_labels: list of str
        Target ordering according to which ``x`` will be reordered. ``labels`` should be a subset of ``ordered_labels``.
    labeled_axis: int or tuple of int
        Axis along which ``x`` will be labeled. If a tuple, each axis will be assumed to have identical labels, and
        and reorganization will be done on all requested axes together (NOT fancy indexing!)

    Returns
    -------
    x_sorted: TensorVariable
        Output tensor. Each ``labeled_axis`` is padded to the length of ``ordered_labels``, then reordered.

    """
    Add two tensors based on labels associated with one dimension.

    When combining statespace matrices associated with structural components with potentially different states, it is
    important to make sure that duplicated states are handled correctly. For bias vectors and covariance matrices,
    duplicated states should be summed.

    When a state appears in one component but not another, that state should be treated as an implicit zero in the
    components where the state does not appear. This amounts to padding the relevant matrices with zeros before
    performing the addition.

    When labeled_axis is a tuple, each provided label is assumed to be identically labeled in each input tensor. This
    is the case, for example, when working with a covariance matrix. In this case, padding and alignment will be
    done on each indicated index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor: TensorVariable
        A statespace matrix to be summed with ``other_tensor``.
    other_tensor: TensorVariable
        A statespace matrix to be summed with ``tensor``.
    labels: list of str
        Dimension labels associated with ``tensor``, on the ``labeled_axis`` dimension.
    other_labels: list of str
        Dimension labels associated with ``other_tensor``, on the ``labeled_axis`` dimension.
    labeled_axis: int or tuple of int
        Dimension that is labeled by ``labels`` and ``other_labels``. ``tensor.shape[labeled_axis]`` must have the
        shape of ``len(labels)`` at runtime.

    Returns
    -------
    result: TensorVariable
        Result of addition of ``tensor`` and ``other_tensor``, along the ``labeled_axis`` dimension.  The ordering of
        the output will be ``labels + [label for label in other_labels if label not in labels]``. That is, ``labels``
        come first, followed by any new labels introduced by ``other_labels``.
