.. py:class:: PTC10(address: str, *_args, macros: dict | None = None, observables: dict | None = None, **_kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`herosdevices.core.templates.TelnetDeviceTemplate`


   Driver for the SRS PTC10 programmable temperature controller.

   This driver connects via telnet to the ethernet port.

   :param address: IP address of the device. Example: "192.168.1.5"
   :param channels_out: Names of the output channels. Example: ["WindowOut","OvenOut"]
   :param channels_tc: Names of PTC330 extension cards input channels.
   :param macros: A dict of macros which are written to the temperature controller and can be called with
                  :py:meth:`run_macro`. The dictionary keys are the names and the values the actual macro code. Note, that
                  the macro content must be a single line string. Example:
                  {"OvenOn": "if (OvenOut.PID.setpoint==0){ OvenOut.PID.setpoint=50 }else{ popup \"Oven already on\" }"}
   :param observables: A dictionary of attributes that are emitted with the `observable_data` event if the device is
                       started as a `PolledDatasourceHero`. If no values are given, the set temperature, actual temperature and
                       TEC power are emitted.

   Besides the implemented functions, you can also directly send raw commands to the controller by using
   :py:meth:`send_raw_command` for maximum flexibility.

                  send_raw_command(command: str, read_echo: Literal[True]) -> str

      Send a command to the device.

      :param command: Command to send. Can end (but does not have to) in a command termination like `\n`. See the device
                      manual for available commands.
      :param read_echo: If a response should be read from the device.



   .. py:method:: stop_macro(name: str) -> None | str

      Stop a running macro.

      :param name: Name of the macro to stop.



   .. py:method:: run_macro(name: str) -> str

      Run a macro on the hardware.

      If the macro is present in the macros dictionary (see :py:meth:`__init__` for details), it will be send to
      the device first.

      :param name: Name of the macro to run.



   .. py:method:: define_macro(name: str, content: str) -> str

      Send a new macro with the given name and content to the device.

      :param name: Name of the macro to define.
      :param content: The content of the macro.
