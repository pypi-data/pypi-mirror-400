<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Although many studies have shown that microbes can ectopically stimulate or suppress plant immune responses, the fundamental question of whether the entire preexisting microbiota is indeed required for proper development of plant immune response remains unanswered. Using a recently developed peat-based gnotobiotic plant growth system, we found that Arabidopsis grown in the absence of a natural microbiota lacked age-dependent maturation of plant immune response and were defective in several aspects of pattern-triggered immunity. Axenic plants exhibited hypersusceptibility to infection by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Microbiota-mediated immunocompetence was suppressed by rich nutrient conditions, indicating a tripartite interaction between the host, microbiota and abiotic environment. A synthetic microbiota composed of 48 culturable bacterial strains from the leaf endosphere of healthy Arabidopsis plants was able to substantially restore immunocompetence similar to plants inoculated with a soil-derived community. In contrast, a 52-member dysbiotic synthetic leaf microbiota overstimulated the immune transcriptome. Together, these results provide evidence for a causal role of a eubiotic microbiota in gating proper immunocompetence and age-dependent immunity in plants.</p><p>The aboveground and belowground parts of land plants host a variety of microorganisms, which collectively constitute the plant microbiota. Microbiota members can reside on or inside plants and appear to be taxonomically conserved at the phylum level <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> . The broad conservation of plant microbiota suggests that plants probably have evolved mechanisms to select and maintain the abundance, composition and function of microbiota to achieve homoeostasis 9 . A correctly assembled microbiota (that is, eubiotic microbiota) is probably essential for plant health and survival as recent studies have begun to reveal deleterious effects of genetically induced dysbiotic microbiotas on plant health <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>performed the classical flg22 protection assays using 2.5-week-old and 3.5-week-old Arabidopsis plants, which were conventionally grown in a potting soil substrate in air-circulating growth chambers. In 2.5-week-old plants, we observed a modest level of flg22-mediated resistance to virulent Pst DC3000 in flg22-treated plants compared with mock-treated plants. Older, 3.5-week-old plants, however, exhibited a significantly enhanced level of flg22-triggered resistance compared with 2.5-week-old plants (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). This result demonstrated age-dependent development of PTI in soil-grown Arabidopsis plants, which is consistent with a recent study showing that FLS2-dependent immunity increased in the first 6 d of young seedling growth in agar medium without microbes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age-dependent PTI maturation requires microbiota</head><p>Traditionally, age-related resistance has been attributed to developmental transition processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> . We examined an additional hypothesis that the endogenous microbiome might be involved in age-dependent PTI in plants. For this purpose, we investigated the temporal maturation of flg22-mediated resistance in peat-based gnotobiotic plant growth systems. Holoxenic (HO) plants colonized with a natural, soil-derived microbial community ('MSU', collected from agricultural soil located at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan; see Methods) and corresponding axenic (AX) plants, which were mock inoculated with autoclaved 'microbial community derived from the same 'MSU' soil', were used. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>, HO plants exhibited progressively more robust flg22-mediated resistance against Pst DC3000 over time, which is consistent with age-dependent PTI observed in plants grown conventionally in potting soil (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). In contrast, AX plants mock-inoculated with the autoclaved microbial community were greatly reduced in age-dependent flg22-mediated resistance phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>). Arabidopsis mutant bak1-5 bkk1-1 cerk1 (bbc) (ref. 46), which is defective in PTI signalling downstream of multiple PRRs, including the flg22 receptor FLS2, did not show flg22-mediated resistance in HO plants at any age (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), suggesting that microbiota-mediated age-dependent resistance requires canonical PTI signalling co-receptors.</p><p>Next, we quantified induction of the PTI marker gene FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1 (FRK1) to further characterize age-dependent activation of PTI in HO plants and apparent lack thereof in AX plants. While basal expression of FRK1 was similar for both 3.5-and 5.5-week-old HO plants (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>), flg22 induced a higher level of FRK1 expression in old HO plants than in younger HO plants (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>). Interestingly, basal expression of FRK1 was lower in AX plants compared with either young or old HO plants (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>) and, notably, no significant age-dependent increase in flg22-induced FRK1 expression was observed in AX plants (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>). Thus, the reduced age-dependent maturation of PTI in AX is correlated with a lack of robust increase in age-dependent expression of FRK1 gene.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Axenic plants lack normal expression of defence genes</head><p>To capture genome-wide gene expression in AX and HO plants beyond the FRK1 marker gene, we conducted transcriptome analysis of AX and HO Arabidopsis plants grown in the peat gnotobiotic system. To reduce the possibility of community-specific bias due to the use of a single microbiota, microbial communities collected from two distinct soils were used: 'MSU', which was collected as Alfisol soil type, and 'Malaka', which was collected from undisturbed grassland soil in Malaka Township, Iowa (see Methods) and is a Mollisol soil. Principal component analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq gene expression data revealed distinct expression patterns between HO plants and AX plants (PC1, 26% variance; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref>). Using |log 2 FC| ≥ 1 and false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 cut-off, we identified a total of 435 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HO and AX plants across both microbiota inputs: 352 were depleted in AX plants and 83 were enriched in AX plants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref> and Supplementary Data 1). Of the 352 DEGs depleted in AX plants, 138 were depleted irrespective of the microbiota input source (that is, enriched in both HO plants colonized by the 'MSU' community and HO plants against potentially harmful exploitations by microorganisms, plants have evolved cell surface and intracellular immune receptors that recognize evolutionarily conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or pathogen-derived effector proteins, resulting in pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) or effector-triggered immunity (ETI), respectively. While ETI appears to be specific for pathogens, PTI represents a basal line of plant defence against both pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes and is required for maintaining a eubiotic phyllosphere microbiota in Arabidopsis to prevent dysbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . PTI signalling is initiated upon perception of PAMPs by plasma membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . For example, a 22-amino-acid epitope derived from bacterial flagellin (flg22) is a well characterized elicitor of PTI and is recognized by the PRR FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE 2 (FLS2) (ref. 18). FLS2 forms a complex with co-receptor BRASSINOS-TEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1) (ref. 19). Phosphorelays between FLS2, BAK1, BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) and a MAPK cascade initiate downstream PTI signalling events, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium fluxes, expression of a large suite of defence-related genes, cell wall remodelling and stomatal closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> . Activation of PTI before an infection can also result in enhanced pathogen resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</p><p>Age-related resistance (ARR) is a widely observed phenomenon in plants in which young plants exhibit greater disease susceptibility compared with older plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . This is observed across many flowering plants against a variety of pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . In Arabidopsis, for instance, the basal susceptibility of young plants to the foliar bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 is greater compared with older plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . One hypothesis to explain ARR involves the growth-defence trade-off concept: to balance resource allocations during vigorous vegetative growth early in life, young plants prioritize growth over defence <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Indeed, there is evidence of direct molecular connections between plant growth and immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> , including common dual-function signalling components as in the case of PTI and brassinosteroid-dependent plant growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . However, it is unclear whether molecular connections such as these are a sole basis for ARR in plants. In the animal kingdom, development of gnotobiotic animals such as germ-free mice led researchers to discover an important contribution of endogenous microbiota in postnatal maturation of innate immune responses in newborn animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . This raises the possibility that plant microbiota may also contribute to the maturation of plant immunity. However, it remains an open question whether age-dependent immunity is entirely intrinsic to plant development or whether maturation of PTI is, in part, the result of colonization of a microbiota. Furthermore, in animals, the presence of dysbiotic microbial communities can be linked to exaggerated immune responses, which have debilitating clinical consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . Genetically induced and naturally occurring dysbiotic microbial communities have recently been described in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> , but it is not clear whether dysbiotic microbiota in plants are associated with overactive immune responses. Addressing these basic microbiome questions requires the development of proper gnotobiotic plant growth systems and establishment of well characterized normal (eubiotic) and dysbiotic microbial communities.</p><p>In a recent study, we reported two peat-based gnotobiotic plant growth systems, FlowPot and GnotoPot <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , and two synthetic bacterial communities, a eubiotic community from healthy Arabidopsis leaves and a dysbiotic community from leaves of the Arabidopsis min7 fls2 efr cerk1 (mfec) quadruple mutant, which lacks the ability to maintain a eubiotic endophytic bacterial community <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . Here we employed these tools to address the questions regarding the role of the endogenous microbiome in the development of ARR and a possible role of eubiosis in gating proper plant basal immunity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age-dependent PTI in conventionally grown plants</head><p>We began this project by characterizing possible maturation of PTI over time in conventionally grown Arabidopsis plants. For this purpose, we Article <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-023-01501-1">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-023-01501-1</ref> colonized by the 'Malaka' community; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2d</ref>). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of these 138 'core' AX-depleted genes revealed an over-representation of terms involved in plant immunity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2e</ref> and Supplementary Data 2). The genes enriched in AX plants did not display any significant GO term enrichment. Closer examination of depleted DEGs in AX plants revealed numerous genes involved in PTI, defence hormone salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defence and defence-associated metabolite biosynthesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2c</ref> and Supplementary Data 1). These genes included FRK1; several leucine-rich repeat protein kinases such as IMPAIRED OOMYCETE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (IOS1), AT1G51890, AT1G51790, AT1G51860 and AT5G59680; systemic immunity-associated genes AZELAIC ACID INDUCED 1 (AZI1) and AZI3; PATHOGENESIS RELATED 2 (PR2) and PR4; glucosinolate biosynthesis genes such as FAD-LINKED OXIDOREDUCTASE (FOX1) and the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP71A12 and CYP71B15; and defence-associated transcription factors MYB15 and WRKY 30 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2c</ref> and Supplementary Data 1). Thus, consistent with the targeted FRK1 gene expression analysis shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, results from the transcriptome analysis using two independent soil-derived microbiotas pointed to a broadly depleted PTI/SA defence gene expression in AX plants compared with HO plants, which collectively contribute to induced and basal innate immunity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Axenic Arabidopsis is underdeveloped in PTI</head><p>In addition to depleted immune gene expression, we found that AX plants exhibited significantly lower levels of other PTI-associated immune responses compared with HO plants. For example, 6-week-old AX plants exhibited significantly reduced flg22-, elf18-and Pep1-induced ROS production compared with HO plants both in the magnitude of maximum ROS production (peak amplitude) and in the time to reach the maximum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). AX plants also exhibited significantly reduced PAMP/DAMP-induced FRK1 gene expression compared with HO plants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>). Western blot analysis revealed that despite possessing similar levels of total MPK3 and MPK6 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>), less MPK was phosphorylated in AX plants after the activation of PTI by treatment with flg22 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3e</ref>). Although reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis consistently showed that both basal and flg22-induced expression of the FLS2 receptor gene is significantly reduced in AX plant leaf tissue compared with HO plant leaf tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3f</ref>), total FLS2 protein abundance was variable and only occasionally reduced in AX plant leaves (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). In contrast, the co-receptor BAK1 protein was consistently found in lower relative abundance in AX plants compared with HO plants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3g</ref>). In addition, quantification of the defence hormone SA, which is downstream of PTI signalling, revealed that AX plants possess lower basal levels of SA compared with HO plants (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>). Finally, AX plants were hypersensitive to infection by the virulent foliar hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000 and the necrotrophic fungal pathogen B. cinerea compared with HO plants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3h</ref>,<ref type="figure">i</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A eubiotic leaf synthetic community confers immunocompetence</head><p>We recently assembled a 48-member eubiotic SynCom (SynCom Col-0 ) composed of endophytic bacteria from leaves of healthy Arabidopsis Col-0 plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . To determine to what extent an eubiotic SynCom derived from the leaf endosphere could restore immunocompetence to AX plants, we compared the PTI phenotypes of Col-0 plants grown with and without SynCom (SynCom Col-0 vs MgCl 2 ). Col-0 plants grown with the 'MSU' soil-derived microbiota were used as control. We observed robust flg22-induced production of ROS in HO plants inoculated with the 'MSU' soil-derived microbiota and SynCom Col-0 -inoculated plants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>). We next quantified flg22-induced FRK1 gene expression and observed that plants colonized by SynCom Col-0 were restored in basal and flg22-induced FRK1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>), which was again similar to that observed for HO plants (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>,<ref type="figure">e</ref>). In addition, plants colonized by SynCom Col-0 had an increased level of BAK1 protein (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>) and were more resistant to Pst DC3000 infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d</ref>) compared with AX plants mock-inoculated with the same volume of 10 mM MgCl 2 . Taken together, these results suggest that a leaf endosphere-derived bacterial SynCom can substantially restore immune competence to AX plants similar to a natural soil-derived microbiota. To evaluate possible redundancy of SynCom Col-0 members in contribution to immune competence, we assembled a simplified version of SynCom Col-0 with only 19 strains (SynCom  ) to cover the taxonomic diversity at the genus level (Supplementary Data 3). We found that SynCom Col-mix19 could effectively restore ROS production in response to flg22 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). Furthermore, among strains with high representation in SynCom Col-0 , we randomly chose a mix of three strains that are present in SynCom Col-mix19 and found that these three strains (SynCom Col-mix3 , representing Achromobacter, Comamonas and Stenotrophomonas genera) also partially restored ROS production in response to flg22 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). This suggests that there might be significant redundancy among strains of SynCom Col-0 that can endow immunocompetence.</p></div>

To systematically determine the effects of nutrients on microbiota-mediated immunocompetence, we measured flg22-induced production of ROS in AX and HO plants along a nutrient concentration gradient. Using the same volume of liquid, GnotoPots were prepared with full strength (1x) LS, half strength (0.5x) LS and one tenth strength (0.1x) LS. We observed a significant impact of nutrients on flg22-mediated ROS production in HO plants. Decreasing nutrient strength significantly increased ROS burst magnitude and shortened time to reach the maximum ROS production (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>) in HO plants. At intermediate nutrient levels (0.5x LS), ROS burst magnitude was moderately increased and time to reach the maximum was reduced compared with higher (1x LS) nutrient concentrations, but the total ROS produced was not significantly different (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>).

We next examined the effects of individual components of LS medium, including nitrogen, phosphorus and iron as well as carbon-containing compounds myo-inositol and MES, on microbiota-mediated immunocompetence by supplementing 0.5x LS with each nutrient/compound at the concentration present in 1x LS. Only 1x nitrogen (supplied as NH 4 NO 3 and KNO 3 salts) suppressed flg22-induced ROS production and FRK1 gene expression in HO plants to levels similar to 1x LS (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7b-d</ref>), indicating that high N content plays a major role in suppressing microbiota-mediated immunocompetence.</p><p>To determine whether microbial colonization is affected by nutrient level, we determined the absolute and relative abundance of phyllosphere bacterial microbiota using enumeration of culturable bacteria and 16S ribosomal (r)RNA gene amplicon sequencing in plants supplemented with 0.5x LS or 1x LS. Plants grown with 1x LS harboured approximately 10-fold lower total phyllosphere bacteria microbiota levels compared with plants grown with 0.5x LS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) on weighted UniFrac distances indicated a significant compositional difference between phyllosphere bacterial communities associated with plants grown under the two nutrient levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5c</ref>). Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota and Gammaproteobactera (belonging to the order Pseudomonadales) were observed to be more abundant in the phyllosphere of plants grown with 0.5x LS, whereas their relative abundance was greatly reduced in plants grown with 1x LS. Conversely, Gammaproteobacteria belonging to order Burkholderiales increased in relative abundance in plants grown with 1x LS compared with those grown with 0.5x LS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5d</ref>). Together, these findings illustrate a tripartite interaction among immunity, microbiota and environment during microbiota-mediated maturation of flg22-triggered immunity.</p></div>

In particular, we were able to establish two parallel leaf endosphere-derived bacterial SynComs: 48-member SynCom Col-0 derived from healthy Col-0 leaves and 52-member SynCom mfec derived from dysbiotic mfec mutant leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . To investigate the impact of a normal (eubiotic) microbiota vs a dysbiotic microbiota on plant immunity, we examined the expression of several immunity-associated marker genes (FRK1, PR1 and CYP71A12) in plants colonized with SynCom mfec or SynCom Col-0 in comparison to AX plants in a plate-based gnotobiotic system. We found a gradient of expression of these genes, with the highest expression observed in Col-0 plants colonized by SynCom mfec , an intermediate level in SynCom Col-0 -colonized plants and the lowest level in AX plants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6a-c</ref>).</p><p>To gain a better understanding of plant transcriptional responses to eubiotic microbiota vs a dysbiotic microbiota, we performed RNA-seq analysis of Col-0 plants colonized by SynCom mfec and SynCom Col-0 grown in parallel in the GnotoPot system. Colonization with SynCom Col-0 compared to SynCom mfec resulted in 774 DEGs (|log 2 FC| &gt; 1 and FDR &lt; 0.05) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6d</ref> and Supplementary Data 4). GO term analysis of the 609 DEGs upregulated upon colonization with SynCom mfec vs SynCom Col-0 showed an over-representation of GO terms associated with biotic stress and immunity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6e</ref> and Supplementary Data 5). In addition, several immunity pathways including the systemic acquired resistance, PTI signalling and glucosinolate biosynthetic processes were upregulated. Further analysis showed that several dysbiosis-associated genes were involved in pathogenesis-related processes during biotic stresses, which are associated with immunity, cell death and its regulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6f</ref>). Collectively, our results showed that dysbiotic SynCom mfec overstimulates immune gene expression compared with eubiotic SynCom Col-0 .</p><p>Next, we examined the capacity of individual SynCom members to potentiate immune stimulation. To facilitate the analysis of immune gene expression involving a large number of microbiota strains (48 SynCom Col-0 strains and 52 SynCom mfec strains), we first performed qualitative β-glucuronidase (GUS) assays with 12-day-old seedlings of the CYP71A12 Pro :GUS reporter line grown in liquid LS media inoculated with each of the 100 individual SynCom members. We found that the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains from both SynCom Col-0 (4 strains) and SynCom mfec (8 strains) induced CYP71A12 Pro :GUS reporter in leaves. In addition, 4 other strains that are unique to SynCom mfec , including Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila (mfec-41), Stenotrophomonas sp. (mfec-48), Microbacterium sp. (mfec-31) and Pseudomonas citronellolis (mfec-34), showed CYP71A12 Pro :GUS reporter activity in seedling leaves (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Thus, SynCom mfec has higher number and more diverse strains that can induce CYP71A12 promoter activity in leaves. We then performed an independent RT-qPCR-based analysis of CYP71A12 gene expression in leaves of 5-week-old, soil-grown Arabidopsis Col-0 plants, revealing a pattern of CYP71A12 gene expression similar to that of the CYP71A12 Pro :GUS reporter assay, despite very different plant growth conditions in these two independent experiments (Supplementary Data 6). Notably, most of the CYP71A12-induced SynCom members were previously shown to cause dysbiotic symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Here we show that Arabidopsis plants grown without exposure to a microbiota are greatly compromised in age-dependent immunity that occurs in plants colonized naturally by microbiota. Axenically grown plants exhibit significant defects in PTI and are hypersusceptible to infection by the bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000 and the fungal pathogen B. cinerea. We also show that immunocompetence can be restored by natural soil-derived microbiota as well as a 48-member eubiotic bacterial synthetic community (SynCom Col-0 ) derived from leaf endophytic bacteria. In contrast, a 52-member dysbiotic synthetic community derived from leaf endophytic bacteria overstimulates immune gene expression. Finally, our results show that the immune-modulation function of microbiota can be influenced by environmental conditions. Together, these results have notable implications in the formulation of a framework for explaining age-dependent immunity, microbiota-immunity interplay and 'immunity-microbiome-environment' tritrophic interactions in plants.</p><p>With respect to age-dependent immunity, a previous study characterized the ontogeny of flg22-triggered immunity in very young Arabidopsis seedlings (within 6 d after germination) in axenic nutrient agar plates <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> , providing insight into the developmentally controlled maturation of immune responses immediately after germination. Results presented here, however, show that flg22-triggered immunity exhibits an age-dependent maturation period that extends through at least the first 2-3 weeks of vegetative growth and that full-scale age-dependent immune maturation requires exposure to microbiota. As demonstrated here, microbiota-colonized HO plants in peat-based gnotobiotic systems developed age-dependent PTI over time, mirroring plants grown conventionally in potting soil. In contrast, development of age-dependent PTI was greatly reduced in AX plants. The microbiota-mediated age-dependent maturation bears striking conceptual parallels to that observed in germ-free mice in which an represent the mean (±s.d.) expression value (n = 3 plants).

While ARR has typically been proposed to be caused by developmental processes that antagonize immune responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> , results presented here revealed that microbiota-assisted immune maturation is a previously unrecognized contributor that plays an important role in age-dependent immune maturation in plants.</p><p>It should be pointed out that the discovery of a causal role of microbiota in age-dependent immune maturation required the use of a gnotobiotic system capable of growing plants with or without a natural or synthetic community of microbes. Because agar plates, a commonly used gnotobiotic system, are not ideal for natural colonization of plants by a complex microbial community due to artificial overgrowth of some microbes, this has been achieved in this study by using Flow-Pot and GnotoPot gnotobiotic systems with a peat-based substrate, which partially simulates the natural soil substrate. We used FlowPots and GnotoPots interchangeably and some initial experiments were repeated using both systems with similar results. For most subsequent experiments, we used GnotoPots because they allowed plants to grow for a longer duration compared with FlowPots <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . An important realization during this study is that peat-based plant gnotobiotic systems can be fine-tuned to simulate a range of various abiotic conditions, such as nutrients. This was useful for our study because many of the microbiota functions in nature seem to be context dependent. For example, high nitrogen fertilizer regimes have been shown to increase susceptibility of plants grown in a non-sterile hydroponic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> . However, it was not known whether the effect of high-nitrogen nutrients is mediated in part by microbiota. In this study, fine-tuning the nutrient conditions of GnotoPots enabled us to discover that nutrient-mediated immune suppression was most obvious in the presence of microbiota and that high nitrogen has a prominent effect on microbiota level and composition, suggesting an intricate interplay between plant, microbiota and nutrient conditions.</p><p>Recent studies began to illustrate the importance of immunitymicrobiome interplays in plants. For example, we and others have recently shown that PTI-associated PRRs and ROS-generating RBOHD/F are essential components of a plant genetic network in configuring a normal eubiotic leaf microbiota to prevent health-damaging dysbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . Similarly, bacterial members of both leaf and root microbiotas either stimulate or suppress PTI-associated gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . In this study, we found that a synthetic community composed of 48 culturable Arabidopsis phyllosphere bacteria (SynCom Col-0 ) was sufficient to restore immunocompetence in the leaves of AX plants at a level similar to that conferred by a natural soil-derived microbial community. This is interesting considering that most members of the leaf bacterial microbiota live on the surfaces and less than 5% of leaf bacteria reside inside the leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . Results presented here suggest either the importance of endophytic leaf bacteria in maturing immune responses in Arabidopsis leaves or the presence of multiple functionally redundant subcommunities of any given microbiota, with each subcommunity capable of independently conferring immune maturation to plants. In either scenario, there seems to be substantial redundancy among different phyllosphere strains in endowing immunocompetence (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). The role of microbiota in modulating immunocompetence seems robust across different plant growth conditions used in our study. When we analysed the transcriptome profiles of plants colonized by SynCom Col-0 vs natural microbiota (HO Malaka or HO MSU ), compared to the corresponding axenic plants, enrichment of immune-associated genes was observed in both cases (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>), even though plants were grown under different conditions, including different growth-substrate mixtures and photoperiods (see Methods). Interestingly, enriched immune genes observed in our study include 20 so-called 'general non-self response (GNSR)' genes that are commonly induced by 13 individual strains from the At-LSPHERE collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> . The GNSR genes constitute 9% of the upregulated genes (20/213) commonly enriched in plants inoculated with natural microbiotas and SynCom Col-0 in this study. Overall, our study is consistent with the existence of a broader core microbiota-associated transcriptome response and highlights the importance of a natural or eubiotic community in shaping the transcriptome landscape of basal immune responses in plants.</p><p>Another important implication of the findings from this study is that not only do Arabidopsis plants require a microbiota to properly develop PTI, but also that the composition of the microbiota is important. We found that SynCom Col-0 , a eubiotic microbiota derived from healthy Arabidopsis leaves, was sufficient to restore immunocompetence to AX plants. In contrast, SynCom mfec , a dysbiotic microbiota derived from leaves of the Arabidopsis mfec quadruple mutant, overstimulated immune gene expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). This observation suggests that a healthy, eubiotic microbiota is necessary to properly gate the plant immune system. We think that this is an important observation because in human-microbiome interactions, dysbiosis is associated with autoimmune ailments such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, allergies and other health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> . Thus, an intimate interplay between immunity and microbiota appears to be core to host-microbiome interactions in both animal and plant kingdoms. Deviations from a eubiotic microbiota could result in immunodeficiency (as in the case of AX plants) or immune overstimulation (as in the case of SynCom mfec -inoculated plants). Thus, a eubiotic microbiota has a fundamental role in gating plant immune response during growth and development.</p></div>

Samples were extracted overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The next day, samples were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE membrane (Millipore, UFC30LG25) and transferred to autosampler vials. Injections (10 μl) of prepared extracts were separated using an Ascentis Express fused-core C18 column (2.1 × 50 m, 2.7 μm) heated to 50 °C on an Acquity ultra performance liquid chromatography system (Waters Corporation). A gradient of 0.15% formic acid in water (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) was applied over 2.5 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min -1 . Separation consisted of a linear increase from A:B (49:1) to 100% B. Transitions from deprotonated molecules to characteristic product ions were monitored for ABA-2 H 6 (m/z 269.1 &gt; 159.1), SA (m/z 137.0 &gt; 93.0) and SAG (m/z 299.1 &gt; 137.0) on a Quattro Premier tandem mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation) in negative ion mode.

H 4-week-old wildtype (Col-0) and bbc mutant HO plants were treated 24 hours before inoculation with Pst DC3000 (OD 600 = 0.002) with either a water (mock) or 100 nM flg22 solution. Each column represents the mean bacterial titer 24 hours after inoculation as log transformed cfu/cm 2 (n = 3 plants). Error bars indicate SD. (Col-0: p = 7.74 × 10 -9 , bbc: not significant; two-way ANOVA with Šidák's multiple comparison test). This experiment was repeated three independent times with similar results. Exact p-values for all comparisons are detailed in the Source Data. Extended Data Fig. 2 | Axenic Arabidopsis plants exhibit decreased total ROS production upon PTI elicitation compared to holoxenic plants. Total ROS production induced by 250 nM flg22, elf18, and Pep1 in AX and HO plants in GnotoPots. Results calculated from data presented in Fig. 2a by determining the mean area under curve (n = 8 plants). Error bars indicate SD (flg22: p = 6.07 × 10 -5 , elf18: p = 3.77 × 10 -5 , Pep1: p = 0.03; two-way ANOVA with Fisher's LSD test). This experiment was repeated three independent times with similar results. Extended Data Fig. 3 | FLS2 protein abundance in axenic and holoxenic plants. Total FLS2 protein detected in whole leaf tissue lysate of four pooled plants. Two experimental repeats show variability in FLS2 relative abundance. Ponceau S stain of all blots show equal loading. This experiment was repeated five times with variable results. Blots from two representative experiments shown. See Source Data for image cropping. Extended Data Fig. 4 | SA and glucosylated SA abundance in axenic and holoxenic plants. a,b, Total levels of salicylic acid (SA) (a) and glucosylated SA (b) in AX and HO plants. Each bar represents the mean values (n = 6 biologically independent plant samples). Error bars represent SD (SA: p = 0.003, SAG: p = 0.002; two-tailed unpaired t-test). This experiment was repeated three independent times with similar results. Extended Data Fig. 5 | SynComCol-0 restores immunocompetence. a, Total ROS production induced by 100 nM flg22 in plants colonized by HO or SynCom Col-0 . Results calculated from data presented in Fig. 3a by determining the mean area under curve ± SD (n = 12 plants). Different letters represent a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD post-hoc test). Exact p-values for all comparisons are detailed in the Source Data. b, Total BAK1 protein detected in leaf lysates of 6-week-old plants mock-inoculated with 10 mM MgCl 2 and plants colonized by SynCom Col-0 .

Error bars represent SD (compared to 0.5x LS: p = 0.0051 ( + N), p = 0.0009 (1x LS), q = 0.0184 (AX), all others ns; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett test). d, FRK1 gene expression in AX and HO plants induced by 250 nM flg22. Total RNA was extracted from leaf disks 1.5 h after treatment. PP2AA3 was used for normalization. Bars represent the mean value (n = 8 plants). Error bars indicate SD (compared to 0.5x LS: p = 0.0180 ( + N), p = 0.0169 (1x LS), p = 0.0234 (AX), all others ns; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett test). a-d, Experiments were repeated a minimum of two independent times with similar results. a,c,d, Exact p-values for all comparisons are detailed in the Source Data. Extended Data Fig. 9 | Leaf transcriptomes of plants colonized with natural community and SynCom Col-0 share common immune-related gene expression. a. Venn diagram of upregulated DEGs showed 213 common Arabidopsis genes in response to natural microbiota and SynCom Col-0 colonization. Significant DEGs were identified using DESEq2 with |log 2 FC | &gt; 1 and FDR &lt; 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Wald Test) criteria in a comparison of HO plants (colonized by microbial communities from two different locations/ soil types 'MSU' and 'Malaka') and SynCom Col-0 -colonizedplants with their corresponding AX control. b, A subset of the differentially regulated genes in HO and SynCom Col-0 plants, compared to corresponding AX plants, is shown. Heat map of the DEGs was generated using hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and complete linkage. c-e, Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment (GO:BP biological process) analysis on 213 common enriched DEGs in both HO and SynCom Col-0 , only in HO or only in SynCom Col-0 plants, compared to their respective AX control plants. Top enriched GO terms are displayed, ranked by significance (FDR &lt; 0.05 cutoff). The 213 enriched DEGs common in both HO and SynCom Col-0 (panel c) showed highest fold enrichment for immunity-associated GO terms. GNSR genes present in the subset of 213 DEGs common in both HO and SynCom Col-0 are marked in red in panel b. a-e, n = 3 biologically independent plant samples per condition.</figDesc></figure>
