class VelocityVoltage:
    """
    Request PID to target velocity with voltage feedforward.
    
    This control mode will set the motor's velocity setpoint to the velocity
    specified by the user. In addition, it will apply an additional voltage as an
    arbitrary feedforward value.
    
    :param velocity: Velocity to drive toward in rotations per second.
    :type velocity: rotations_per_second
    :param acceleration: Acceleration to drive toward in rotations per second
                         squared. This is typically used for motion profiles
                         generated by the robot program.
    :type acceleration: rotations_per_second_squared
    :param enable_foc: Set to true to use FOC commutation (requires Phoenix Pro),
                       which increases peak power by ~15% on supported devices (see
                       SupportsFOC). Set to false to use trapezoidal commutation.
                       
                       FOC improves motor performance by leveraging torque (current)
                       control.  However, this may be inconvenient for applications
                       that require specifying duty cycle or voltage. 
                       CTR-Electronics has developed a hybrid method that combines
                       the performances gains of FOC while still allowing
                       applications to provide duty cycle or voltage demand.  This
                       not to be confused with simple sinusoidal control or phase
                       voltage control which lacks the performance gains.
    :type enable_foc: bool
    :param feed_forward: Feedforward to apply in volts This is added to the output
                         of the onboard feedforward terms.
    :type feed_forward: volt
    :param slot: Select which gains are applied by selecting the slot.  Use the
                 configuration api to set the gain values for the selected slot
                 before enabling this feature. Slot must be within [0,2].
    :type slot: int
    :param override_brake_dur_neutral: Set to true to static-brake the rotor when
                                       output is zero (or within deadband).  Set to
                                       false to use the NeutralMode configuration
                                       setting (default). This flag exists to
                                       provide the fundamental behavior of this
                                       control when output is zero, which is to
                                       provide 0V to the motor.
    :type override_brake_dur_neutral: bool
    :param limit_forward_motion: Set to true to force forward limiting.  This allows
                                 users to use other limit switch sensors connected
                                 to robot controller.  This also allows use of
                                 active sensors that require external power.
    :type limit_forward_motion: bool
    :param limit_reverse_motion: Set to true to force reverse limiting.  This allows
                                 users to use other limit switch sensors connected
                                 to robot controller.  This also allows use of
                                 active sensors that require external power.
    :type limit_reverse_motion: bool
    :param ignore_hardware_limits: Set to true to ignore hardware limit switches and
                                   the LimitForwardMotion and LimitReverseMotion
                                   parameters, instead allowing motion.
                                   
                                   This can be useful on mechanisms such as an
                                   intake/feeder, where a limit switch stops motion
                                   while intaking but should be ignored when feeding
                                   to a shooter.
                                   
                                   The hardware limit faults and
                                   Forward/ReverseLimit signals will still report
                                   the values of the limit switches regardless of
                                   this parameter.
    :type ignore_hardware_limits: bool
    :param ignore_software_limits: Set to true to ignore software limits, instead
                                   allowing motion.
                                   
                                   This can be useful when calibrating the zero
                                   point of a mechanism such as an elevator.

    :param use_timesync: Set to true to delay applying this control request until a

                         eliminates the impact of nondeterministic network delays in
                         exchange for a larger but deterministic control latency.
                         
                         This requires setting the ControlTimesyncFreqHz config in
                         MotorOutputConfigs. Additionally, when this is enabled, the

        This can be useful on mechanisms such as an intake/feeder, where a limit switch
        stops motion while intaking but should be ignored when feeding to a shooter.
        
        The hardware limit faults and Forward/ReverseLimit signals will still report the
        values of the limit switches regardless of this parameter.

        Set to true to delay applying this control request until a timesync boundary
        (requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore). This eliminates the impact of
        nondeterministic network delays in exchange for a larger but deterministic
        control latency.
        
        This requires setting the ControlTimesyncFreqHz config in MotorOutputConfigs.
        Additionally, when this is enabled, the UpdateFreqHz of this request should be
        set to 0 Hz.

        Some update frequencies are not supported and will be

        If this field is set to 0 Hz, the control request will
