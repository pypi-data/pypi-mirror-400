"""
Step catalog adapters package.

This package provides backward compatibility adapters that maintain existing APIs
during the migration from legacy discovery systems to the unified StepCatalog system.

The adapters are organized by functionality:
- contract_discovery: Contract discovery and management adapters
- file_resolver: File resolution and discovery adapters
- workspace_discovery: Workspace discovery and management adapters
- config_resolver: Configuration resolution adapters
- config_class_detector: Configuration class detection adapters
