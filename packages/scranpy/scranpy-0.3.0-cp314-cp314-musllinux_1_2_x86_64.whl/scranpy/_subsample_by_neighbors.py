    """Subsample a dataset by selecting cells to represent all of their nearest neighbors.

    Args:
        x:
            Numeric matrix where rows are dimensions and columns are cells, typically containing a low-dimensional representation from, e.g., :py:func:`~scranpy.run_pca`.

            Alternatively, a :py:class:`~knncolle.classes.Index` object containing a pre-built search index for a dataset.

            Alternatively, a :py:class:`~knncolle.find_knn.FindKnnResults` object containing pre-computed search results for a dataset.

        num_neighbors:
            Number of neighbors to use.
            Larger values result in greater downsampling.
            Ignored if ``x`` is a :py:class:`~knncolle.find_knn.FindKnnResults` object.

        nn_parameters:
            Neighbor search algorithm to use.
            Only used if ``x`` does not contain existing neighbor search results.

        min_remaining:
            Minimum number of remaining (i.e., unselected) neighbors that a cell must have in order to be considered for selection.
            This should be less than or equal to ``num_neighbors``.

        num_threads:
            Number of threads to use for the nearest-neighbor search.
            Only used if ``x`` does not contain existing neighbor search results.

    Returns:
        Integer NumPy array containing the indices of the cells selected to be in the subsample.
