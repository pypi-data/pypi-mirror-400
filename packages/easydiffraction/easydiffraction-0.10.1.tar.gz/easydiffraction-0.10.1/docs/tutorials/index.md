# :material-school: Tutorials

This section presents a collection of **Jupyter Notebook** tutorials that
demonstrate how to use EasyDiffraction for various tasks. These tutorials serve
as self-contained, step-by-step **guides** to help users grasp the workflow of
diffraction data analysis using EasyDiffraction.

Instructions on how to run the tutorials are provided in the
[:material-cog-box: Installation & Setup](../installation-and-setup/index.md#how-to-run-tutorials)
section of the documentation.

The tutorials are organized into the following categories.

## Getting Started

- [LBCO `quick` CIF](ed-1.ipynb) – A minimal example intended as a quick
  reference for users already familiar with the EasyDiffraction API or who want
  to see how Rietveld refinement of the La0.5Ba0.5CoO3 crystal structure can be
  performed when both the sample model and experiment are loaded from CIF files.
  Data collected from constant wavelength neutron powder diffraction at HRPT at
  PSI.
- [LBCO `quick` `code`](ed-2.ipynb) – A minimal example intended as a quick
  reference for users already familiar with the EasyDiffraction API or who want
  to see an example refinement when both the sample model and experiment are
  defined directly in code. This tutorial covers a Rietveld refinement of the
  La0.5Ba0.5CoO3 crystal structure using constant wavelength neutron powder
  diffraction data from HRPT at PSI.
- [LBCO `basic`](ed-3.ipynb) – Demonstrates the use of the EasyDiffraction API
  in a simplified, user-friendly manner that closely follows the GUI workflow
  for a Rietveld refinement of the La0.5Ba0.5CoO3 crystal structure using
  constant wavelength neutron powder diffraction data from HRPT at PSI. This
  tutorial provides a full explanation of the workflow with detailed comments
  and descriptions of every step, making it suitable for users who are new to
  EasyDiffraction or those who prefer a more guided approach.
- [PbSO4 `advanced`](ed-4.ipynb) – Demonstrates a more flexible and advanced
  approach to using the EasyDiffraction library, intended for users who are more
  comfortable with Python programming. This tutorial covers a Rietveld
  refinement of the PbSO4 crystal structure based on the joint fit of both X-ray
  and neutron diffraction data.

## Standard Diffraction

- [Co2SiO4 `pd-neut-cwl`](ed-5.ipynb) – Demonstrates a Rietveld refinement of
  the Co2SiO4 crystal structure using constant wavelength neutron powder
  diffraction data from D20 at ILL.
- [HS `pd-neut-cwl`](ed-6.ipynb) – Demonstrates a Rietveld refinement of the HS
  crystal structure using constant wavelength neutron powder diffraction data
  from HRPT at PSI.
- [Si `pd-neut-tof`](ed-7.ipynb) – Demonstrates a Rietveld refinement of the Si
  crystal structure using time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction data from
  SEPD at Argonne.
- [NCAF `pd-neut-tof`](ed-8.ipynb) – Demonstrates a Rietveld refinement of the
  Na2Ca3Al2F14 crystal structure using two time-of-flight neutron powder
  diffraction datasets (from two detector banks) of the WISH instrument at ISIS.
- [LBCO+Si McStas](ed-9.ipynb) – Demonstrates a Rietveld refinement of the
  La0.5Ba0.5CoO3 crystal structure with a small amount of Si impurity as a
  secondary phase using time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction data simulated
  with McStas.

## Pair Distribution Function (PDF)

- [Ni `pd-neut-cwl`](ed-10.ipynb) – Demonstrates a PDF analysis of Ni using data
  collected from a constant wavelength neutron powder diffraction experiment.
- [Si `pd-neut-tof`](ed-11.ipynb) – Demonstrates a PDF analysis of Si using data
  collected from a time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction experiment at NOMAD
  at SNS.
- [NaCl `pd-xray`](ed-12.ipynb) – Demonstrates a PDF analysis of NaCl using data
  collected from an X-ray powder diffraction experiment.

## Workshops & Schools

- [2025 DMSC](ed-13.ipynb) – A workshop tutorial that demonstrates a Rietveld
  refinement of the La0.5Ba0.5CoO3 crystal structure using time-of-flight
  neutron powder diffraction data simulated with McStas. This tutorial is
  designed for the ESS DMSC Summer School 2025.
