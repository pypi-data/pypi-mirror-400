description: |
  This is an example custom rule that demonstrates the YAML rule format.

  Custom rules allow you to define project-specific checks that will be
  evaluated by the LLM during code analysis. Unlike traditional linters,
  Dinocheck uses semantic understanding to detect issues.

checklist:
  - First condition to check for
  - Second condition to check for
  - Third condition the LLM should verify

fix: |
  Describe how to fix the issue when detected.
  This guidance is shown to developers and also helps the LLM
  understand what a correct solution looks like.

tags:
  - custom
  - example

triggers:
  # File patterns (glob) - rule only applies to matching files
  file_patterns:
    - "**/views.py"
    - "**/api/*.py"

  # Code patterns (regex) - triggers LLM analysis when matched
  code_patterns:
    - "dangerous_function\\("
    - "unsafe_operation\\("

examples:
  bad: |
    # Bad example - what to avoid
    def process_data(user_input):
        dangerous_function(user_input)  # Unsafe!

  good: |
    # Good example - how to do it right
    def process_data(user_input):
        sanitized = sanitize(user_input)
        safe_function(sanitized)  # Safe!
