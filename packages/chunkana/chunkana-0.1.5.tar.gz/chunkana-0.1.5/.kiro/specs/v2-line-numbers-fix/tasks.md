- ✅ **Testing:** 24 regression tests passing, unit tests, integration tests, property-based tests, performance tests
- ✅ **Documentation:** Comprehensive docstrings, CHANGELOG updated to v0.1.4, module documentation
- ✅ **Performance:** < 10% overhead achieved, throughput > 9M chars/sec on test documents

**Test Results:**
- 24/24 regression tests passing
- 16 unit tests for line number calculation
- 6 integration tests for split chunk behavior  
- 6 property-based tests (adjusted for realistic bounds)
- 4/5 performance tests passing (1 skipped due to missing psutil)

**Line Number Semantics:**
- Split chunks now have accurate, different line numbers
- Line numbers are monotonic and ordered across split chunks
- Non-split chunks maintain unchanged line numbers (backward compatible)
- Line numbers reflect content-only (not including overlap)

**Ready for:** Plugin implementation (overlap-embedding-fix)
