# Static files directory

This directory is used to serve bundled frontend assets when
running the ADK Agent Simulator in production mode.

During development, the frontend is served separately by Angular's dev server.

To bundle the frontend for production:
1. Build the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run build`
2. Copy the built files to this directory

The `adk-sim` CLI will serve these files from the root URL.
