# The structure under HOME will be placed into the user's home directory, and the
#     structure under ROOT will be placed into the root directory ("/") (requires '--root' arg to enable).
# The final values may be
# - null (indicating an empty directory/file to create)
#     (type (folder/file) is inferred from if a suffix is present (e.g. '.txt'))
# - (str) a github repository reference (indicating a repo to clone from)
#           (see see 'parse_git_ref' function in this repo for expected format)
# - (str) a URL (indicating a file to download from), starting with "http(s)://"
# - (str) a local path (indicating a file/directory to copy from) you may add the "symlink://" prefix
#           to create a symlink instead of copying. Also, the user's home (~) will be expanded.
# Recommended: Add custom executable scripts and aliases in $HOME/.cmds, then add it to PATH
