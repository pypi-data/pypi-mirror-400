    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"Sampling Parameters\" notebook, we introduced a few core concepts that will be heavily used throughout this notebook and are worth reviewing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A *parameter* is effectively a variable in the mathematical equations that is instantiated during a round of sampling. A simple model might contain a handful of parameters for everything from position on the sky (RA, Dec) to inherent physical quantities (hostmass) to purely functional parameters (curve decay rate). \n",
    "* A `ParameterizedNode` is a computational unit for working with parameters. These nodes provide the code that defines the recipe for computing its own parameters. These nodes may use inputs that are parameters computed within other nodes.\n",
    "* A `GraphState` is a data structure that holds the sampled values for all the parameters in the model. Each `ParameterizedNode` object is stateless and does not store information about the parameters themselves. Instead all operations take a `GraphState` that contains the necessary input parameters and will store the corresponding output parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined values of **all** the parameters in the graph define a single sample of the model's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use one `ParameterizedNode` object to provide parameters for another object. As described in the previous notebook, this chaining can use the output of a node as the input to another node:"
