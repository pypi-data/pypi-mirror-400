An AI-powered data aggregation tool that intelligently analyzes a dataset and provides smart suggestions for aggregation strategies.

## Description

This agent analyzes a given dataset and its associated metadata (such as domain description, entity descriptions, and column descriptions) to propose intelligent data aggregation strategies. It uses a large language model to:

1.  **Identify** the most relevant columns to group the data by.
2.  **Suggest** appropriate aggregation methods (e.g., `Sum`, `Mean`, `Max`, `Count`) for the remaining columns based on their data types and context.

This is particularly useful for accelerating feature engineering and preparing data for machine learning or advanced analytics tasks.

## Key Features

-   **Intelligent Data Analysis**: Leverages LLMs to understand the semantic context of your data, including domain, entity, and column descriptions.
-   **Automatic Group-By Identification**: Automatically pinpoints the most meaningful categorical or discrete columns for grouping.
-   **Context-Aware Aggregation Suggestions**: Recommends aggregation functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) that are appropriate for each column's data type and business meaning.
-   **Accelerates Feature Engineering**: Significantly reduces the manual effort required to explore and create aggregated features from raw data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) – A fast Python package and environment manager.
    -   For a quick setup on macOS/Linux, you can use:
        ```bash
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        ```
-   [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the `aggregation_agent` repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stepfnAI/aggregation_agent.git
    cd aggregation_agent
    git switch main
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    This command creates a `.venv` folder in the current directory and installs all required packages.
    ```bash
    uv sync --extra dev
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

## Configuration

You can configure the agent in two ways: using a `.env` file for project-specific settings or by exporting environment variables for more dynamic, shell-level control. Settings loaded via `export` will take precedence over those in a `.env` file.

### Available Settings

The following table details the configuration options available:

| Environment Variable        | Description                                  | Default      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`            | **(Required)** Your OpenAI API key.          | *None*       |
| `AGGREGATION_AI_PROVIDER`   | AI provider for aggregation suggestions.     | `openai`     |
| `AGGREGATION_MODEL`         | AI model for aggregation suggestions.        | `gpt-4o`     |
| `TEMPERATURE`               | AI model temperature (e.g., `0.0` to `2.0`). | `0.3`        |
| `MAX_TOKENS`                | Maximum tokens for the AI response.          | `4000`       |
| `GROUP_BY_AI_PROVIDER`      | AI provider for group-by column mapping.     | `openai`     |
| `GROUP_BY_MODEL`            | AI model for group-by column mapping.        | `gpt-4o`     |

### Method 1: Using a `.env` File (Recommended)

For consistent configuration within your project, create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your settings. This method is ideal for storing API keys and project-wide defaults.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project.
2.  Add the key-value pairs for the settings you wish to override.

#### Example `.env` file:

```dotenv
# .env

# --- Required Settings ---
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"

# --- Optional Overrides ---
# Use a different model for aggregation
AGGREGATION_AI_PROVIDER="anthropic"
AGGREGATION_MODEL="claude-3-sonnet-20240229"

# Use a higher temperature for more creative responses
TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

---

### Method 2: Using `export` Commands

For temporary settings or use in CI/CD environments, you can `export` variables directly in your terminal shell. These variables are set for the current session and will override any values defined in your `.env` file.

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Use the `export` command to set a variable before running your application.

#### Example `export` commands:

This example sets a different model and token limit for a single run of your script.

```bash
# Set the environment variables for the current terminal session
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"
export AGGREGATION_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
export MAX_TOKENS=6000
```

**Note:** The variable names are identical for both the `.env` file and the `export` command. The application will automatically detect and use them based on this hierarchy.
## Testing

To run the test suite, use the following command from the root of the `aggregation_agent` directory:

```bash
pytest
```

## Usage

### Running the Example Script

To see a quick demonstration, run the provided example script from the root of the project directory. This will execute the agent with pre-defined metadata and print the resulting aggregation suggestions to the console.

```bash
python example/basic_usage.py
```

### Using as a Library

You can also integrate the `AggregationAgent` directly into your Python applications. The following example demonstrates how to define your data's context and get intelligent aggregation suggestions.
```python
from aggregation_agent import AggregationAgent
