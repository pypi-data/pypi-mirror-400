# NLBook: Natural Language Notebooks. 

Authors: 

Luca de Alfaro, dealfaro@acm.org

## Overview

Natural Language Notebooks (NLBook) allow you to create notebooks where the cells are written in natural language. 
The natural language is automatically converted to code via AI, and executed.
The natural language is retained, so you can edit it, improve it, and so forth. 

Differently from other notebook systems, NLBooks are executed from start to end: random cell execution order, as in Jupyter notebooks, is not allowed.  This ensures that the results are obtained in the same order in which a human reader would read the notebook.

This project is in an early stage of development.

## Running NLBook

```bash

nlbook path/to/notebook.nlb
``` 

(where `.nlb` is a Natural Language Notebook file; you can use other extensions if you wish). 
For a list of command-lien options, do: 

```bash
nlbook --help
```

## Development

Run with: 

```bash
python -m nlbook.main --debug
```

Running with the VSCode launch.json does not work, due to a VScode bug/quirk. 
See DEVELOP.md for development instructions, and see TODO.md for planned features.
