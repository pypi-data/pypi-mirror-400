    "This notebook describes how to use LightCurveLynx to perform parallel computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core simulation function of the model can take a `concurrent.futures.Executor` object and use that to distribute the computation over multiple processes. This object can be a built in parallelization method, such as `ThreadPoolExecutor` or `ProcessPoolExecutor`, or other libraries, such as Dask.\n",
    "\n",

    "  * Each process will load a full version of all the data, so they may be memory intensive.\n",
    "  * Not all subpackages work with distributed computation yet. If you get an error about not being able to pickle an object, please let the LightCurveLynx team know so we can investigate. We are aware the PZFlowNodes are currently failing."
