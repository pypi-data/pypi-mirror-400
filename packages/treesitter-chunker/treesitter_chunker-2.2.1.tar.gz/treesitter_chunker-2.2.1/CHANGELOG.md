## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-02

Test release

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-02

Release notes

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-02

Patch release

## [2.0.4] - 2025-12-27

### ✨ Features

- **Content-insensitive definition_id (REQ-TSC-011)**: Added `definition_id` field to `CodeChunk` that provides a stable identifier based on symbol location and structure, independent of content changes. This enables reliable tracking of code entities across versions.
- **Enhanced cross-reference graph (REQ-TSC-008)**: Improved `build_xref` to better reconcile dependencies vs references for REFERENCES edges, providing more accurate relationship mapping in code graphs.

### 🧪 Testing

- **ConfigurationError test coverage**: Added comprehensive test suite for `ConfigurationError` exception class in `tests/test_exceptions.py`
- **Fixed test imports**: Updated `tests/test_config_advanced_scenarios.py` to use the real `ConfigurationError` class instead of workaround

### 🔧 Workflow Improvements

- **Updated CI/CD workflows**: Removed Python 3.10 from test matrices to match `requires-python = ">=3.11"` requirement
- **Improved linting**: Scoped ruff checks to production code and tests, excluding archive and logs directories
- **Enhanced test coverage**: Added `ConfigurationError` to exception hierarchy and error message formatting tests

---

## [2.0.3] - 2025-11-28

### 🐛 Bug Fix

- **Added ConfigurationError class**: Added the missing `ConfigurationError` exception class to `chunker/exceptions.py` that was referenced by `chunker/utils/json.py` but never committed

---

## [2.0.2] - 2025-11-28 [YANKED]

**Note**: This version is missing the `ConfigurationError` class. Use v2.0.3 instead.

### 🐛 Bug Fix

- **Fixed ImportError on module import**: Made `toml` import optional in `chunker/processors/config.py` to fix ImportError that prevented any chunker imports in v2.0.1

---

## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-27 [YANKED]

**Note**: This version has critical bugs - the `toml` package import fails, and `ConfigurationError` is missing. Use v2.0.3 instead.

### 🔧 Pre-Production Finalization (v4 Spec)

#### Internal Improvements
- **Safe Decode Migration**: Migrated 11 language plugins to use centralized `safe_decode_bytes` utility from `chunker/utils/text.py` for consistent UTF-8 handling with graceful fallback on encoding errors
  - Affected plugins: clojure, go, vue, zig, haskell, sql, python, cs_plugin, scala, java_plugin, elixir
- **JSON Loading Consistency**: Migrated JSON configuration loading to use centralized `load_json_file` utility from `chunker/utils/json.py` for consistent error handling
  - `chunker/grammar/repository.py`: Custom grammar repository loading
  - `chunker/chunker_config.py`: ChunkerConfig JSON support
  - `chunker/config/strategy_config.py`: StrategyConfig JSON support

#### Error Handling
- JSON parsing errors now raise `ConfigurationError` with detailed line/column information
- Invalid UTF-8 in source files handled gracefully with replacement characters

#### API Surface
- No breaking changes to public API
- All function signatures in `chunker/__init__.py` unchanged
- HTTP API endpoints in `api/server.py` unchanged

#### Testing
- All existing tests pass
- New validation tests for utility functions
- Security tests verified (no `shell=True`, no bare `except:`)
