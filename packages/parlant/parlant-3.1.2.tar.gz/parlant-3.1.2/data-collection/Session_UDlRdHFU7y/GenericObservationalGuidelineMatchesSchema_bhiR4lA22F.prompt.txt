GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
In our system, the behavior of a conversational AI agent is guided by how the current state of its interaction with a customer (also referred to as "the user") compares to a number of pre-defined conditions:

- "condition": This is a natural-language condition that specifies when a guideline should apply.
          We evaluate each conversation at its current state against these conditions
          to determine which guidelines should inform the agent's next reply.

The agent will receive relevant information for its response based on the conditions that are deemed to apply to the current state of the interaction.

Task Description
----------------
Your task is to evaluate the relevance and applicability of a set of provided 'when' conditions to the most recent state of an interaction between yourself (an AI agent) and a user.

A guideline should be marked as applicable if it is relevant to the latest part of the conversation and in particular to the most recent customer message. Do not mark a guideline as
applicable solely based on earlier parts of the conversation if the topic has since shifted, even if the previous topic remains unresolved or its action was never carried out.

If the conversation shifts from a broad issue to a related sub-issue (a detail or follow-up within the same overall topic), the guideline remains applicable as long as it’s relevant to that sub-issue.
However, once the discussion moves to an entirely new topic, previous guidelines should no longer be considered applicable.
A guideline is not applicable when the customer explicitly sets aside or pauses the original issue to address something else, even if they plan to return to it later.
Similarly, if the conversation has progressed beyond the specific sub-topic mentioned in the condition and into a different aspect or next stage of the general topic, the condition no longer applies.
This approach ties applicability to the current conversational context while preserving continuity when exploring related subtopics.

Persistent Facts: Conditions about user characteristics or established facts (e.g., "the user is a senior citizen", "the customer has allergies") apply once established based on the information in this prompt,
regardless of current discussion topic.

When evaluating whether the conversation has shifted to a related sub-issue versus a completely different topic, consider whether the customer remains interested in resolving their previous inquiry that fulfilled the condition.
If the customer is still pursuing that original inquiry, then the current discussion should be considered a sub-issue of it. Do not concern yourself with whether the original issue was resolved - only ask if the current issue at hand is a sub-issue of the condition.

The exact format of your response will be provided later in this prompt.




Examples of Condition Evaluations:
-------------------
Example #1: ###

- **Interaction Events**:
[
  {
    "event_kind": "message",
    "event_source": "user",
    "data": {
      "message": "Hi, I'm planning a trip to Italy next month. What can I do there?"
    }
  },
  {
    "event_kind": "message",
    "event_source": "ai_agent",
    "data": {
      "message": "That sounds exciting! I can help you with that. Do you prefer exploring cities or enjoying scenic landscapes?"
    }
  },
  {
    "event_kind": "message",
    "event_source": "user",
    "data": {
      "message": "Can you help me figure out the best time to visit Rome and what to pack?"
    }
  },
  {
    "event_kind": "message",
    "event_source": "user",
    "data": {
      "message": "Actually I\u2019m also wondering \u2014 do I need any special visas or documents as an American citizen?"
    }
  }
]


- **Guidelines**:
1) The customer is looking for flight or accommodation booking assistance
2) The customer asks for activities recommendations
3) The customer asks for logistical or legal requirements.


- **Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "guideline_id": "<example-id-for-few-shots--do-not-use-this-in-output>",
      "condition": "The customer is looking for flight or accommodation booking assistance",

      "condition": "The customer asks for activities recommendations",
      "rationale": "The customer has moved from seeking activity recommendations to asking about legal requirements. Since they are no longer pursuing their original inquiry about activities, this represents a new topic rather than a sub-issue",
      "applies": false
    },
    {
      "guideline_id": "<example-id-for-few-shots--do-not-use-this-in-output>",

    "event_source": "user",
