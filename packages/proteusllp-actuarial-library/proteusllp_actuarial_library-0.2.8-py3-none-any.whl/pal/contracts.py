        Calculation of the recoveries from the excess of loss contract:

        Firstly, the effect of any franchise or reverse franchise is calculated
        on the individual losses.

        losses post franchise = loss if loss >= franchise and loss<= reverse franchise

        Next the individual losses to the layer are calculated:

        layer_loss = min(max(losses post franchise - excess, 0), limit)

        Then the aggregate layer losses before aggregate limit and deductible
        are calculated.
        The aggregate limit and deductible are then applied to get the aggregate
        recoveries for the layer:

        aggregate_recoveries = min(
            max(aggregate_layer_losses - aggregate_deductible, 0),
            aggregate_limit
        )

        The aggregate recoveries are then allocated back to the individual losses
        in proportion to the individual recoveries before aggregate limit and
        deductible.

        The reinstatement premium is calculated as the sum of the reinstatement
        premium cost multiplied by the number of reinstatements used.
        The number of reinstatements used is calculated as the minimum of the
        aggregate recoveries divided by the limit and the number of
        reinstatements available (which is the aggregate limit divided by the
        occurrence limit, less one).
