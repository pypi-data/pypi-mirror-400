    Apply the ``.table`` class to all HTML tables within generated articles.

    This is so the Bootstrap CSS works as expected.

    Note that BeautifulSoup's round-tripping (parsing and re-writing) is not
    "pixel perfect" and may change the final HTML. In particular, the `lxml`
    and `html5lib` parser will add the `<html>` and `<body>` if they are
    missing. Here, we are dealing with the entire HTML document, so that
    particular change, if it happens, shouldn't be an issue.
