      <h2>NIDRA v0.2.2 - super simple sleep scoring</h2>
      An easy way to use powerful machine learning models to autoscore sleep recordings with excellent accuracy. No programming required, but Python endpoints are available. NIDRA can accurately score recordings from 2-channel EEG wearables such as ZMax (using ezscore-f models), as well as full PSG recordings (using U-Sleep 2.0 via sleepyland).
      <br>
      <h3>Please see the <a href="https://nidra.netlify.app/">NIDRA Manual</a> for a detailed user guide, installation, and examples.</h3>
      <h3>Download the <a href="https://github.com/paulzerr/nidra/releases/latest/download/NIDRA_installer.exe"> NIDRA GUI installer for Windows 10/11</a></h3>
      <h3>Or install from PyPI:</h3> (clean virtual environment recommended)
<pre>
pip install nidra
</pre>
Then launch the GUI:
<pre>
nidra
</pre>
Or use as Python package:
<pre>
import NIDRA
scorer = NIDRA.scorer(
    type  = 'psg',
    input = '/path/to/recording.edf'
)
scorer.score()
</pre>

## Features
 
  *   Uses state-of-the-art, validated, high-accuracy deep learning models to reliably classify sleep stages.
  *   `ezscore-f` models for 2-channel EEG wearables (e.g., ZMax).
  *   `u-sleep-nsrr-2024` (U-Sleep 2.0) model for full polysomnography.
  *   Simple point-and-click interface (GUI) for non-programmers.
  *   Flexible `NIDRA.scorer()` endpoint for developers and data pipelines.
  *   Autoscore single or multiple files or folders.
  *   Accepts in-memory numpy arrays for real-time applications.
  *   Automatic channel detection.
  *   Outputs sleep stages, classifier probabilities (hypnodensity), and sleep statistics.
  *   Visual reports with spectrograms and hypnograms.
  *   Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
