## Core Sustainability Metrics

### Contributor Redundancy

**Alternative Name:** Bus Factor (Estimated)

**Purpose:** Evaluates whether the project depends on a single contributor or has a healthy distribution.

**⚠️ Important Limitations:**

This metric is **estimated from public commit history only** and has significant limitations:

- **Cannot see internal Git mirrors** - Many organizations use internal Git systems that sync to public repos, making contribution patterns appear more concentrated than reality
- **Code-only view** - Ignores non-code contributions like documentation, issue triage, community management, and project governance
- **No organizational context** - Cannot detect succession planning, knowledge transfer practices, or full-time maintainer status
- **Snapshot, not trajectory** - Recent patterns may not reflect long-term team structure or onboarding efforts

**Use this metric as a signal to investigate further, not as a definitive assessment.** Projects with a single dominant contributor may have:

- Strong corporate backing with internal teams
- Active mentorship and onboarding processes
- Clear governance and succession plans
- Other forms of redundancy not visible in commit history

**Data Source:** Commit history (recent commits analyzed)

**Calculation:**

- Identifies top contributor percentage from recent commits
- Adjusts scoring based on project maturity (total commits)
- Analyzes contributor diversity trend

**Scoring:**

- <50% by single contributor: 10/10 (Excellent - healthy diversity)
- 50-69% concentration: 5/10 (Moderate - acceptable)
- 70-89% concentration: 3/10 (Needs attention - concentrated contributions)
- 90%+ concentration: 1/10 (Needs support - single point of failure)

**Status Levels:**

- **None:** <50% - Well-distributed contributions
- **Low:** 50-69% - Acceptable concentration
- **Medium:** 70-89% - Elevated concentration
- **High:** 90%+ - Significant dependency concentration

**CHAOSS Alignment:** ✅ [Elephant Factor](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-elephant-factor/), [Contributor Absence Factor](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-contributor-absence-factor/)

**Use Case:** Organizations should prioritize projects with high redundancy to avoid single-maintainer concentration.

---

### Maintainer Retention

**Alternative Name:** Maintainer Drain

**Purpose:** Tracks whether maintainers are staying active or leaving the project.

**Data Source:** Commit authorship over time, excluding automated commits (bots)

**Calculation:**

## Scoring System

### Scale

All metrics use a **0-10 point scale** for consistency:

| Score | Meaning | Color |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **9-10** | Excellent | 🟢 Green |
| **7-8** | Good | 🟢 Green |
| **4-6** | Moderate | 🟡 Yellow |
| **1-3** | Needs attention | 🟡 Yellow |
| **0** | Needs support | 🔴 Red |

### Total Score Calculation

Overall Score uses metric weights from the selected scoring profile:

**Overall Score = (Sum(metric_score x weight) / Sum(10 x weight)) x 100**

Example:

- 3 metrics analyzed
- Scores: 8, 6, 10 with weights 2, 1, 1
- Weighted score: (8x2 + 6x1 + 10x1) = 32
- Weighted max: (10x2 + 10x1 + 10x1) = 40
- Overall score: (32/40) x 100 = 80

### Metrics Models

#### 🎯 Stability Model (Stability Focus)

Evaluates maintainability and single-point-of-failure concerns:

- Contributor Redundancy (40%)
- Change Request Resolution (33%)

| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **None** | Excellent health | 9-10 | ✅ No action needed |
| **Low** | Good status | 7-8 | ✅ Monitor occasionally |
| **Medium** | Monitor | 4-6 | 📋 Monitor and plan improvements |
| **High** | Needs attention | 1-3 | 🔴 Address in next quarter |
| **Needs support** | Support needed | 0 | 🚨 Immediate support recommended |

### Interpreting Status Levels

**For Individual Contributors:**

- **High/Needs support:** Consider if project is suitable for production use
- **Medium:** Monitor before major dependency
- **Low/None:** Generally safe to depend on

**For Maintainers:**

- **High/Needs support:** Target for improvement efforts
- **Medium:** Include in roadmap improvements
- **Low/None:** Maintain current practices

---

## Using These Metrics

### Best Practices

1. **Context Matters:** Metrics provide signals, not absolute judgments
2. **Project Stage:** New projects have different patterns than mature ones
3. **Community vs. Corporate:** Different sustainability models apply
4. **Multiple Metrics:** Always review several metrics before making decisions

### Example: Evaluating a Dependency

```bash
# Check comprehensive metrics for a package
oss-guard check numpy --show-models

# Result: Score 82/100
# - Stability Model: 85/100 (Stable, diverse contributors)
# - Sustainability: 75/100 (Active releases, corporate backing)
# - Community: 88/100 (Quick responses, active PRs)
```

**Interpretation:**

- ✅ Good choice for core dependency
- 📋 Note: Sustainability score indicates maintain awareness of releases
- 👥 Strong community support
