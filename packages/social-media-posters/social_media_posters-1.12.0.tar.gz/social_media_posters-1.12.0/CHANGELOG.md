## [1.11.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **JSON Configuration File Support** for all post-to-XYZ actions
  - Load parameters from a JSON configuration file (`input.json` by default)
  - Custom file path via `INPUT_FILE` environment variable
  - Support for both absolute and relative file paths
  - Automatic fallback if JSON file doesn't exist
  - Environment variables take precedence over JSON config values
  - Added `load_json_config()` function in `social_media_utils.py`
  - Updated `get_required_env_var()` and `get_optional_env_var()` to check JSON config
  - Updated `dry_run_guard()` to support JSON config for DRY_RUN parameter
  - **Automatic type conversion** for JSON values to string format:
    - Lists/Arrays converted to comma-separated strings (e.g., `["a", "b"]` → `"a,b"`)
    - Booleans converted to lowercase strings (e.g., `true` → `"true"`, `false` → `"false"`)
    - Numbers converted to strings (e.g., `42` → `"42"`)
    - Null converted to empty string
  - Comprehensive unit tests (`test_json_config_loading.py`, `test_json_value_conversion.py`)
  - Integration tests for all post-to-XYZ scripts (`test_json_config_integration.py`)
  - Documentation in README.md with examples and best practices

### Benefits

- Simplified local development and testing with JSON config files
- Easier management of multiple configurations for different environments
- Better organization of complex parameter sets
- Natural JSON syntax support (use native types like arrays, booleans, numbers)
- Maintains backward compatibility with environment variables and `.env` files
- Clear precedence: Environment Variables > JSON Config > .env File > Defaults

### Fixed

- JSON values are now automatically converted to strings to match environment variable behavior
- Resolves errors when using lists, booleans, or numbers in JSON config (e.g., `'list' object has no attribute 'split'`)
