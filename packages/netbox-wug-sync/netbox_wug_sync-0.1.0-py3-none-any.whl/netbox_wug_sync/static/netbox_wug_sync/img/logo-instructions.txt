WhatsUp Gold Logo PNG Instructions:

To add a PNG logo instead of or in addition to the SVG:

1. Save your logo as 'wug-logo.png' in this directory:
   /netbox_wug_sync/static/netbox_wug_sync/img/

2. Update the dashboard template to use PNG instead:
   Change: src="{% static 'netbox_wug_sync/img/wug-logo.svg' %}"
   To: src="{% static 'netbox_wug_sync/img/wug-logo.png' %}"

3. Recommended logo specifications:
   - Size: 40x40 pixels (or larger, will be scaled)
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Colors: WhatsUp Gold brand colors (blues, golds)

Current SVG logo shows:
- Blue circular background (#0066cc)
- White network nodes
- Gold center node (#ffd700) 
- Network connection lines
- Monitoring wave patterns
