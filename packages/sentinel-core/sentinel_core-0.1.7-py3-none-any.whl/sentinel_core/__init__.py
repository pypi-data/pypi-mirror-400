"""
Sentinel Core - Self-Healing Knowledge Graph Library

This is the pip-installable library that provides core Sentinel functionality:
- Graph storage with temporal validity tracking (Neo4j)
- LLM-based entity and relationship extraction (LiteLLM + Instructor)
- Web scraping with Firecrawl or local fallback
- Autonomous healing orchestration

Usage:
    from sentinel_core import Sentinel, GraphManager, GraphExtractor
    from sentinel_core.scraper import get_scraper
    
    # Initialize components
    graph = GraphManager()
    scraper = get_scraper()  # Auto-selects best available scraper
    extractor = GraphExtractor(model_name="ollama/llama3")
    
    # Create Sentinel orchestrator
    sentinel = Sentinel(graph, scraper, extractor)
    
    # Run autonomous healing
    await sentinel.run_healing_cycle()
