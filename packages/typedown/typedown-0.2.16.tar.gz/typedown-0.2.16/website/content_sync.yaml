# Content Synchronization Configuration
# Defines which local directories/files should be synced to the website public directory.

sync_targets:
  - source: "docs"
    destination: "website/public/docs"
    # Whitelist approach: only these items (and their children) will be synced
    include:
      - "zh"
      - "en"
    # Optional: exclusions within the included paths
    exclude: []

  - source: "examples"
    destination: "website/public/examples"
    include:
      - "zh"
      - "en"
    exclude: []

# Options regarding sync behavior
options:
  # If true, destination directories will be cleaned before copying (but preserving 'exclude' logic if complicated)
  # For safety, we might implement a 'smart clean' that only removes files that are not in the source but are in the destination/whitelist.
  clean_destination: true
