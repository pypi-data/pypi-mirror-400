# GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING SDOM

## General Guidelines

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code style and formatting.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Add docstrings to all public classes, methods, and functions.
- Include unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Open issues or discussions for significant changes before submitting a pull request.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting code.
- Keep dependencies minimal and document any new requirements.
- Review and update documentation as needed.
- Be respectful and collaborative in all communications.

# clone/fork SDOM repo
- Open VS code and use file -> open folder and select the folder where you want to copy the repo.
- Clone in your local the python version of SDOM repo:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Omar0902/SDOM.git
```

# Setting up your enviroment
## Install uv
- Install uv [(A python manager for virtual enviroments, installing packages etc)](https://pypi.org/project/uv/). 
```powershell
pip install uv
```
For further instructions click in the link above.

- Create a virtual enviroment ".venv"
```powershell
uv venv .venv
```
This command creates a new Python virtual environment in the `.venv` directory.

## Install your local SDOM python module and pytest
- To be able to run the tests locally and develop SDOM source code, install your local SDOM module by runing in your powershell terminal (Modify the folder address approprietly):
```powershell
uv pip install -e "C:\YOUR_PATH\SDOM"
```

- It will install also the SDOM dependencies. You should see something like this:

```powershell
 uv pip install -e "C:\YOUR_PATH\SDOM"

 + sdom==0.0.1 (from file:///C:/YOUR_PATH/SDOM)
 + six==1.17.0
 + tzdata==2025.2
```

- Also, install:
  - [pytests.py](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to be able to run the tests locally:
```powershell
uv pip install pytest
```

  - run the following codes to install all the requirements to build SDOM documentation:
```powershell
uv pip install -r Docs\requirements.txt
```

# Running tests locally
The SDOM python version source code have a folder called "tests". This folder contains all the scripts with the unit tests. 

 **⚠️ Attention:**  
>  - Before to push and/or do a pull request please run locally all the tests scripts and make sure all the tests are passing sucessfully.
>  - Please add unit test for all new features and source code implementations.


- To run all the test files:
```powershell
uv run pytest
```

- To run a test python script you can use:
```powershell
uv run pytest tests/TEST_SCRIPT_NAME.py
```
- For instance to run the tests of the script called "test_no_resiliency_optimization_cases.py" you should run
```powershell
uv run pytest tests/test_no_resiliency_optimization_cases.py
```
- This is an example of what you should see:
```powershell
uv run pytest tests/test_no_resiliency_optimization_cases.py

# Build the documentation locally

Please update the documentationd in the folder ``Docs`` for each new feature implementation you are making in a pull request. The SDOM documentation is based on [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html).


 **⚠️ Attention:**  
>  - Before to push and/or do a pull request please build locally the documentation and make sure it does not have any issues.
>  - Please add Docstrings to all code implementations you include in your contributions.
>  - Add proper documentation for the new features before submit a pull request.

- In order to build locally the documentation and check if your changes are correct you can run:

```powershell
uv run .\Docs\make.bat html
```
- to visualize locally the documentation website run
```
start Docs\build\html\index.html
```
