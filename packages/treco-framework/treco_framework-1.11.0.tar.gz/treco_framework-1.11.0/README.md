## 🎯 Overview

TRECO enables security researchers to orchestrate highly precise concurrent HTTP attacks with **sub-microsecond timing accuracy**, making it possible to reliably trigger race conditions in web applications. Built for both Python 3.10+ (with GIL) and Python 3.14t (GIL-free), TRECO achieves unprecedented timing precision for race condition exploitation.

### Common Vulnerabilities Tested

- 💰 **Double-spending attacks** - Payment processing vulnerabilities
- 🎁 **Fund redemption exploits** - Gift cards and coupon abuse
- 📦 **Inventory manipulation** - Limited stock bypasses
- 🔐 **Privilege escalation** - Authentication/authorization flaws
- ⚡ **Rate limiting bypasses** - API quota exhaustion
- 🎟️ **Voucher abuse** - Single-use code reuse
- 🏦 **TOCTOU vulnerabilities** - Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use exploits

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **⚡ Sub-Microsecond Precision**: Race windows < 1μs with barrier synchronization
- **🔓 GIL-Free Option**: Python 3.14t for true parallel execution
- **🧵 Thread Groups**: Define multiple request patterns with distinct thread counts and delays
- **🔄 Flexible Synchronization**: Barrier, countdown latch, and semaphore mechanisms
- **🌐 Full HTTP/HTTPS Support**: HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 with TLS/SSL
- **🎨 Powerful Templates**: Jinja2-based with TOTP, hashing, env vars, and more
- **🎯 Dynamic Input Sources**: Brute-force, enumeration, and combination attacks
- **📊 Automatic Analysis**: Race window calculation and vulnerability detection
- **🔌 Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-based extractors and connection strategies
- **✅ JSON Schema Validation**: IDE integration and real-time validation

## 📦 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install treco-framework

# Or with uv (faster)
uv pip install treco-framework

# Verify installation
treco --version
```

### Your First Test

Create a file `test.yaml`:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: "Race Condition Test"
  version: "1.0"
  author: "Security Researcher"
  vulnerability: "CWE-362"

target:
  host: "api.example.com"
  port: 443
  tls:
    enabled: true

entrypoint:
  state: race_attack
  input:
    voucher_code: "DISCOUNT50"

states:
  race_attack:
    description: "Test voucher race condition"
    race:
      threads: 20
      sync_mechanism: barrier
      connection_strategy: preconnect
    
    request: |
      POST /api/vouchers/redeem HTTP/1.1
      Host: {{ target.host }}
      Content-Type: application/json
      
      {"code": "{{ voucher_code }}"}
    
    next:
      - on_status: 200
        goto: end
  
  end:
    description: "Attack completed"
```

Run the test:

```bash
treco test.yaml
```

## 🚀 Why Python 3.14t?

Python 3.14t removes the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for true parallelism:

| Feature | Python 3.10-3.13 (GIL) | Python 3.14t (GIL-Free) |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **True Parallelism** | ❌ Single thread at a time | ✅ Multiple threads simultaneously |
| **Race Window** | ~10-100μs | **< 1μs** (sub-microsecond) |
| **CPU Utilization** | Limited by GIL | Full multi-core usage |
| **Consistency** | Variable timing | Highly consistent |
| **Best for TRECO** | Good | **Excellent** |

> **Note**: TRECO works with both Python 3.10+ and 3.14t, but achieves optimal performance with 3.14t's free-threaded build.

Install Python 3.14t:

```bash
uv python install 3.14t
uv pip install treco-framework --python 3.14t
```
