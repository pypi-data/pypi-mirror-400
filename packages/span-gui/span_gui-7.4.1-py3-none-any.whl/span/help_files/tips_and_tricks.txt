# Tips and Tricks

Here are some useful tips to help you master SPAN.

1. **Setting the Correct Wavelength Units**  
Due to the variety of 1D spectral formats, SPAN requires you to manually set the wavelength units before loading the spectra.
It does not matter whether the spectra use linear or logarithmic wavelength values: you must specify if the units are in Angstrom (A), nanometers (nm), or micrometers (mu).
If the wavelength units are incorrect, SPAN will display the spectrum with the wrong scale.
Example: If your optical spectra are in A but you set nm, clicking "Plot" will show a range from 48000 to 55000 A, which is incorrect.
To fix this, select the correct wavelength units and plot one selected spectrum again.


2. **Saving and Loading Parameters**  
You can save your session settings, active tasks, and parameters as a .json file via "File --> Save Parameters...".
If you prefer to always load custom default parameters instead of SPAN's defaults, save your parameters via "File --> Save Parameters..." and overwrite the "default_settings.json" file in the "system_files" subfolder.


3. **Managing Spectra Lists and File Organization**  
Spectra loaded into SPAN are organized via a spectra list, generated using the "Generate Spectra List containing 1D spectra" button. Spectra and spectra lists can be stored anywhere on your computer. The spectra lists may also contain non-spectral files (e.g., documentation files): SPAN will automatically ignore invalid files when loading the spectra list.
If your spectra folder contains subdirectories, SPAN will scan all subfolders for valid spectra. Use this feature carefully, as it may include unintended files.


4. **Managing SPAN Results and Directories**  
SPAN stores results in the "SPAN_results" directory. The location of this directory must be decided by you the first time SPAN is run. You can move or delete its contents at any time, but it is recommended to do so only when SPAN is not running.
If SPAN detects missing directories upon startup, it will automatically recreate them.


5. **Improving Lick/IDS Line-Strength Analysis Accuracy**  
The "Emission Line(s) Correction" option in the Lick/IDS line-strength analysis uses pPXF to remove gas emissions from the spectra. This process fits the gas component using E-MILES templates in the 4000-6500 A wavelength range. If the spectra contain edge artifacts (e.g., from X-shooter UVB and VIS arms), the fit may be imperfect.
Solution: Activate the "Cropping" task in the Spectra manipulation panel and crop the spectra to remove problematic regions. If you want to analyze only the 4800-5500 A range for stellar populations, crop the spectra accordingly.


6. **Lick/IDS analysis within the "Stellar populations and SFH" task**
You can perform the Lick/IDS line-strength analysis also within the "Stellar populations and SFH" task by leveraging the results of the fit from pPXF. You just need to activate the option "Lick/IDS analysis with SSP models". Here, you can fit the spectra with any template, on the contrary of the Lick/IDS analysis in the "Line-strength analysis" task and fully adjust the parameters of the fit. In this case, it is strongly recommended to fit also the stellar and gas component and to activate the "Convolve templates to galaxy resolution" option, which allows pPXF to perform a reliable estimation of the velocity dispersion. This is needed to correct the equivalent widths of the Lick/IDS indices for the velocity dispersion broadening and give more accurate results. 


7. **Using "Stellar Populations and SFH" for Kinematics**  
The "Stellar Populations and SFH" task can be used for kinematics analysis too, as an alternative to "Stars and Gas Kinematics". To adapt the settings for kinematics:
    - Set Mult. degree = -1 (disable).
    - Set Add. degree > 0.
    - Enable "Convolve templates to galaxy resolution".
    - Enable "Mask emission lines" if focusing on stellar components.
    - Set Regul. error = 0 to disable regularization.

    
8. **Handling High-Redshift Spectra (z > 0.01)**  
You have two options for handling redshifted spectra:
    - Option 1 (Recommended for multiple tasks): De-redshift the spectra using the "Doppler/z Correction" in the Spectra manipulation panel. Then, set redshift = 0 in the analysis tasks.
    - Option 2: Enter the real redshift value directly in each spectral analysis task.
**Important:**
When de-redshifting spectra, the corrected spectral resolution, if expressed in terms of delta lambda, is: FWHM_gal/(1 + z). If spectra are not de-redshifted, SPAN will automatically adjust the resolution in kinematics and stellar population analyses.


9. **Key Considerations for pPXF and Lick/IDS Analysis**  
When performing kinematics or line-strength index analysis with pPXF, the resolution of the templates must be higher (i.e., lower FWHM) than the resolution of the spectra.
If this is not the case, degrade the resolution using "Degrade Resolution" in the "Spectra Manipulation" panel.
The Lick/IDS index analysis uses a pre-loaded subset of E-MILES templates (Padova isochrones, FWHM = 2.51 A).
If your spectra have higher resolution (FWHM_spec < 2.51 A), degrade the spectra to at least 2.51 A before fitting.


10. **Using sMILES Templates for Stellar Populations and SFH**  
The sMILES SSP templates included in SPAN are a subset of the full library, using a Salpeter unimodal IMF.
They are the only semi-empirical SSPs that sample a wide range of alpha/Fe values and are stored in the "SpectralTemplates/sMILES_afeh" folder. 
You can replace the content of the "sMILES_afeh" folder with a different sMILES SSP dataset (e.g., using a different IMF) and work with any sMILES template.


11. **Processing Spectra with Different Redshifts**  
If your dataset contains spectra with different redshifts (Delta(z) > 0.002) and you wish to use "Process All", you must first de-redshift them.
Use "Doppler/z Correction" --> "I have a file" In the Spectra manipulation panel to apply individual redshifts.
This ensures that all spectra are in the rest frame before spectral analysis.


12. **Handling High-Emission Line Galaxies**  
If analyzing spectra with strong emission lines (i.e. with high star formation), using E-MILES or X-Shooter SSP templates may produce an artificially young and metal-poor population.
If this occurs, use the FSPS library, which includes SSPs as young as 1 Myr (compared to 30-60 Myr in E-MILES and X-Shooter), or create your set of templates. 


13. **Speeding Up Spectral Analysis**  
Cropping spectra to include only the wavelength regions of interest can significantly speed up spectral analysis.


14. **Stellar populations with Lick/IDS indices**  
The determination of the stellar parameters with the Lick/IDS indices and the GPR method uses predictive machine-learning models and the scikit-learn module. The default models stored in the system_files folder have been trained with the scikit-learn 1.7.0 version. If you are using different version for this library, the predictions may be inaccurate and a warning is issued in the output window. In this case you should delete the trained models stored in the "system_files" folder (the files have the .pkl extension) and run again SPAN. If the Lick/IDS task with GPR stellar parameters determination does not find the trained models, it will create again the first time is executed, using the scikit-learn version you have installed. This will require a little time, but then you can use these new trained models until you change the version of the scikit-learn module.
