Code Edit Agent: {self.get_info()} on source files.
Use this agent when you need to:
- View file contents with line numbers
- Create new source files
- Make precise string replacements in existing files
- Fix bugs by modifying code
- Add new functions or classes to existing files
- Refactor code by replacing patterns

This agent uses exact string matching for replacements, ensuring precise edits.
The agent will refuse to edit files outside allowed directories for security.

Accepts: text (file path and operation details)
Produces: text (operation result or file contents)

To call this agent write {self.get_opening_tag()} CODE_EDIT_TASK_DESCRIPTION {self.get_closing_tag()}
Describe what file operation you need to perform.
