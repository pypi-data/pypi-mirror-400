    def set_control(self, request: TorqueCurrentFOC) -> StatusCode:
        """
        Request a specified motor current (field oriented control).
        
        This control request will drive the motor to the requested motor
        (stator) current value.  This leverages field oriented control (FOC),
        which means greater peak power than what is documented.  This scales
        to torque based on Motor's kT constant.
        
        - TorqueCurrentFOC Parameters: 
            - output: Amount of motor current in Amperes
            - max_abs_duty_cycle: The maximum absolute motor output that can be applied,
                                  which effectively limits the velocity. For example,
                                  0.50 means no more than 50% output in either
                                  direction.  This is useful for preventing the motor
                                  from spinning to its terminal velocity when there is
                                  no external torque applied unto the rotor.  Note this
                                  is absolute maximum, so the value should be between
                                  zero and one.
            - deadband: Deadband in Amperes.  If torque request is within deadband, the
                        bridge output is neutral. If deadband is set to zero then there
                        is effectively no deadband. Note if deadband is zero, a free
                        spinning motor will spin for quite a while as the firmware
                        attempts to hold the motor's bemf. If user expects motor to
                        cease spinning quickly with a demand of zero, we recommend a
                        deadband of one Ampere. This value will be converted to an
                        integral value of amps.
            - override_coast_dur_neutral: Set to true to coast the rotor when output is
                                          zero (or within deadband).  Set to false to
                                          use the NeutralMode configuration setting
                                          (default). This flag exists to provide the
                                          fundamental behavior of this control when
                                          output is zero, which is to provide 0A (zero
                                          torque).
            - limit_forward_motion: Set to true to force forward limiting.  This allows
                                    users to use other limit switch sensors connected to
                                    robot controller.  This also allows use of active
                                    sensors that require external power.
            - limit_reverse_motion: Set to true to force reverse limiting.  This allows
                                    users to use other limit switch sensors connected to
                                    robot controller.  This also allows use of active
                                    sensors that require external power.
            - ignore_hardware_limits: Set to true to ignore hardware limit switches and
                                      the LimitForwardMotion and LimitReverseMotion
                                      parameters, instead allowing motion.
                                      
                                      This can be useful on mechanisms such as an
                                      intake/feeder, where a limit switch stops motion
                                      while intaking but should be ignored when feeding
                                      to a shooter.
                                      
                                      The hardware limit faults and Forward/ReverseLimit
                                      signals will still report the values of the limit
                                      switches regardless of this parameter.
            - ignore_software_limits: Set to true to ignore software limits, instead
                                      allowing motion.
                                      
                                      This can be useful when calibrating the zero point
                                      of a mechanism such as an elevator.
                                      
                                      The software limit faults will still report the
                                      values of the software limits regardless of this
                                      parameter.
            - use_timesync: Set to true to delay applying this control request until a
                            timesync boundary (requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore). This
                            eliminates the impact of nondeterministic network delays in
                            exchange for a larger but deterministic control latency.
                            
                            This requires setting the ControlTimesyncFreqHz config in
                            MotorOutputConfigs. Additionally, when this is enabled, the
                            UpdateFreqHz of this request should be set to 0 Hz.

        Motion Magic® produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting

        Target position can be changed on-the-fly and Motion Magic® will do
        its best to adjust the profile. This control mode is based on torque
        current, so relevant closed-loop gains will use Amperes for the
        numerator.

                    Jerk is optional; if this is set to zero, then Motion Magic® will
                    not apply a Jerk limit.

            - limit_forward_motion: Set to true to force forward limiting.  This allows

                                    robot controller.  This also allows use of active
