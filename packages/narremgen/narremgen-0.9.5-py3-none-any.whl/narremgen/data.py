narremgen.data
=============
LLM-driven generation of the core Advice, Context, and Mapping CSV tables.

Wraps LLMConnect calls and post-processing to generate clean,
semicolon-separated datasets with stable naming conventions, forming the
entry point of the Narremgen pipeline.

    """
    Generate a CSV table of short advices for a given topic.

    advice_context is an optional free-form background used as an epistemic anchor.
    It defines the world model, constraints, hypotheses, and assumptions that guide
    which angles are selected before writing advice items.

    Each advice row contains:
    - ``Num`` (integer index)
    - ``Topic`` (string)
    - ``Advice`` (short title)
    - ``Sentence`` (a spoken line by a character)

    The function prompts the language model to output a strict semicolon-separated
    CSV with exactly these four columns and no extra lines. A lightweight
    post-processing step repairs malformed rows and counts how many advices
    were actually usable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    topic : str
        The input topic that each advice line should refer to.
    n_advice : int, optional
        Number of advice rows requested from the model. Default is 20.
    output_dir : str, optional
        Directory where the CSV output is saved. Default is "outputs".
    advice_context : str or None, optional
        Optional free-form background injected only into the advice generation prompt.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, prints additional progress information.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[str | None, int]
        A pair ``(csv_path, num_rows)`` where ``csv_path`` is the path to the
        generated advice CSV (or ``None`` if generation failed), and ``num_rows``
        is the number of valid advice rows after post-processing.
