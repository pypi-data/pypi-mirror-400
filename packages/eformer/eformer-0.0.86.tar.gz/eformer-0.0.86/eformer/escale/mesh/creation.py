"""JAX mesh creation utilities for distributed computation.

This module provides utilities for creating and managing JAX meshes for distributed
computation across multiple devices. It supports various parallelism strategies including:

- Data Parallelism (dp): Replicates model across devices, splits data
- Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (fsdp): Shards both model and data across devices
- Expert Parallelism (ep): For mixture-of-experts models
- Tensor Parallelism (tp): Splits individual tensors across devices
- Sequence Parallelism (sp): Splits sequence dimension across devices

Key Features:
    - Automatic device mesh creation for single/multi-host setups
    - Support for TPU slices and multi-process environments
    - CPU-specific utilities for debugging and testing
    - String-based mesh configuration parsing
    - Caching for efficient mesh reuse

Typical Usage:
    >>>
    >>> mesh = create_mesh(
    ...     axis_dims=(2, 4),
    ...     axis_names=('data', 'model')
    ... )
    >>> with mesh:
    ...
    ...     pass

    >>>
    >>> mesh = parse_mesh_from_string("dp:2,tp:4", ["dp", "tp"])

    >>>
    >>> with cpu_context() as mesh:
    ...
    ...     pass
