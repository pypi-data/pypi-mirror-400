Quotation You can obtain the cost of a shipment in a quote by using the
"Add shipment" wizard and selecting Dachser as the carrier.

Create shipment When you validate a picking linked to a Dachser carrier,
a shipment will be created, the corresponding tracking number will be
defined, and the corresponding label will be added as an attachment.

Update shipment status The status of Dachser shipments will be updated
automatically on the pickings.

Cancel shipment If a shipment has been created in Dachser (it has a
tracking number), the shipment can be canceled (depending on its
status).
