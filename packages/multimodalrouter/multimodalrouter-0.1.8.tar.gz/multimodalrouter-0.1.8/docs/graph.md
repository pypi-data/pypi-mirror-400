# RouteGraph

The `RouteGraph` is the central class of the package implemented as a dynamic (cyclic) directed graph. It defines all graph building and routing related functions.


##  Functionality

### initialization

This creates a new graph with no `Hubs` or `Edges`.

```python
def __init__(
    self, 
    maxDistance: float,
    transportModes: dict[str, str],
    dataPaths: dict[str, str] = {},
    compressed: bool = False,
    extraMetricsKeys: list[str] = [],
    drivingEnabled: bool = True,
    sourceCoordKeys: list[str] = ["source_lat", "source_lng"],
    destCoordKeys: list[str] = ["destination_lat", "destination_lng"],
):
```

#### args

Terminology:

> Hub Type: hub types are the user defined names for their hubs. e.g. when having data for flights you have `airports`, thus you may want to define the hubs for the airports as type `airport`. (Hub Types can be anything you want to name them) 

- ``maxDistance``: float = The maximum distance a driving edge is allowed to span
- ``transportModes``: dict[str, str] = a dictionary that assigns Hub Types to their mode of travel. E.g. 
```python
transportModes = {
    'airport': 'fly',# here hub type airport is assigned its primary mode of travel as fly
}
```
- ``dataPaths``: dict[str, str] = a dictionary that stores the paths to datasets realtive to their Hub Types. E.g.:
```python
dataPaths = {
    # hub type: path to dataset
    'airport': '~/MUltiModalRouter/data/AirportDataset.parquet'
}
```
- ``compressed``: bool = wheter to save this graph in compressed files or not (NOTE: this is not used at the moment so just skip)
- ``extraMetricsKeys``: list[str] = a list of metrics the graph will search for in the datasets when building edges (NOTE: default metrics must still be present)
Example:
```python
# given at least one dataset with the col 'time'

extraMetricsKeys = ['time']
```
When the graph finds this key in a dataset it will then add this metric (here `time`) to all edges that come from hubs stored inside this dataset

- ``drivingEnabled``: bool = whether the graph should connect all possible hubs that have $distance(a,b) \leq maxDistance$ (default=True)
- `sourecCoordKeys`: list[str] = a list of keys from your data that contains the column names from your source coordinates. (NOTE: if you have more than one dataset you can just put all source keys into this list as long as the same keys arent for any other metric somewhere else)
- `destCoordKeys`: list[str] = a list of keys from your data that contains the column names of the destination coordinates. (same conditions as for source apply)

> NOTE: the source and dest coord keys are matched to the correct datasets automatically you can just bundle them all together in one list

#### example

Init a graph with Hubs: `airport`, `trainstation`

```python
from multimodalrouter import RouteGraph

graph = RouteGraph(
    maxDistance = 50,
    transportModes = {
        'airport': 'plane',
        'trainstation': 'train'
    },
    dataPaths = {
        'airport': pathToAirportData,
        'trainstation': pathToTrainData
    }
    # time and cost must each be present in at least one dataset
    extraMetricsKeys = ['time', 'cost'], 
    # default is True so this is not necessary 
    drivingEnabled = True, 
)
```

The resulting graph will be able to build `HUbs` for both `train stations` and `airports`. It will also use the extra metrics in all edges where the data is present

### build

After a graph is initialized it doesn't contain any actual nodes or edges yet. To create the nodes and edges the graph has to be build.

```python
def build(self):
```

#### example

click [here](#example) to see how to init the graph

```python
# with the graph from the previous example

graph.build()
```

After this finishes the graph is build and ready for routing

### routing / finding the shortest Path form A to B

```python
def find_shortest_path(
    self, 
    start_id: str, 
    end_id: str, 
    allowed_modes: list[str],
    optimization_metric: OptimizationMetric | str = OptimizationMetric.DISTANCE,
    max_segments: int = 10,
    verbose: bool = False
    ) -> Route | None:
```

#### args

- start_id: str = the Hub.id of the starting hub (e.g. the source field for this hub in your data -> for `airports` likely the iata code) (for coordinate searches see [here](#searching-with-coordinates))
- end_id: str = the Hub.id of the traget Hub
- allowed_modes: list[str] = a list of transport modes that are allowed in the path (all edges with different modes are excluded)(The modes are set during the graph [initailization](#args))
- optimization_metric: str = the metric by which the pathfinder will determine the length of the path (must be numeric and present in all searched edges) (default = `distance`) (metrics where also set during [initialization](#args))
- max_segments: int = the maximum number of hubs the route is allowed to include (default = 10 to avoid massive searches but should be setvrealtive to the graph size and density)
- verbose: bool = whether you want to store all edges and their data in the route or just the hub names (default=False)

**returns** : [Route](#route) or None if no route was found

### radial search /finding all hubs inside a radius

> Note: this doesn't search a direct radius but rather a reachablity distance (e.g.: A and B may have a distance $x \leq r$, but the shortest connecting path has distance $y \geq r$)

```python
def radial_search(
    self,
    hub_id: str,
    radius: float,
    optimization_metric: OptimizationMetric | str = OptimizationMetric.DISTANCE,
    allowed_modes: list[str] = None,
    custom_filter: Filter = None
) -> list[float, Hub]:
```

#### args

- `hub_id`: str = the id of the center hub the search starts at
- `radius`: float = the maximum value the search metric is allowed to have from the start
- `optimization_metric`: str = the target metric you want to use for the distance (default='distance')
- `allowed_modes`: list[str] = the types of edges that are considered (default= None => all edges are checked)
- `custom_filter`: Filter = a [filter](#filter) object you can pass to add filters for Hubs and edgeMetadata

**returns:** list[ tuple[float, [Hub](#hub)] ] = a list of all reachable hubs with the 'distance' to the start

### save

```python
def save(
    self, 
    filepath: str = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "..", "..", "..", "data"), 
    compressed: bool = False):
```

The `save` method will create a save file from the last garph state. Depending on the `arguments` the file will either be stored as `.dill` or `.zlib`.
A save file contains the complete statedict of the RouteGraph instance except attributes that could break the pickling process (e.g. ``threading.Lock``).

#### args

- filepath: str = the directory that the savefile will be stored in (defaults to `MultiModalRouter/data`)
- compressed: bool = whether to compress the output into `.zlib` or store as `.dill`

#### example

Saving a graph to a custom dir, in a `.dill` file

```python
...
graph.save(filepath=customDir)
```

### load

```python
@staticmethod
def load(
    filepath: str, 
    compressed: bool = False
) -> "RouteGraph":
```

The load method is a static method that allows you to load a graph from its save file into a new graph object.
The resulting graph object is fully initialized and can be used as is.

#### args

- filepath: str = the full path to your save file 
- compressed: bool = set this to `True` if your graph was saved to a `.zlib` compressed file (default=`False`)

#### example

```python
from multimodalrouter import RouteGraph
# load a .dill file from 'pathToMyGraph'
myGraph = RouteGraph.load(filepath=pathToMyGraph) 
```

The `myGraph` object is now fully loaded and can be used to its full extend.

### searching with coordinates

Since searching by hub id is not always possible the graph has a helper that finds a hub closest to a coordinate tuple.

```python
def findClosestHub(
    self, 
    allowedHubTypes: list[str], 
    coords: list[float],
) -> Hub | None:
```

#### args


- allowedHubTypes: list[str] = a list that defines which hubs should be searched (e.g. ['airport','trainstation'])
**NOTE:** if you set this to `None` all hubs will be included in 
the search
- coords: list[float] = the coordinates of the hub. (not limited to 2 dimensions)

> NOTE: the coords must not necessarily be in degrees or any other meaningfull metric aslong as your data provides distances and you turn of enableDrive when building the graph or you do [this](./graph.md#advanced-options)

> NOTE: it is entirely possible to setup the graph with custom coordinate systems and distances

#### example

```python
coordinates = 100.0, 100.0
closestHub = graph.findClosestHub(
    allowedHUbTypes = None, # include all types in search
    *coordinates, 
)
```

> NOTE: you can now use `closestHub.id` in the [search](#routing--finding-the-shortest-path-form-a-to-b)

### getting hubs by id

If you want to inspect a hub and you know its `id` you can get it from the graph as follows

```python
def getHub(
    self, 
    hubType: str, 
    id: str
) -> Hub | None:
```

or 

```python
def getHubById(
    self, 
    id: str
) -> Hub | None:
```

#### args

- hubType: str = the type of the target hub
- id: str = the id of the target hub

**returns:** the Hub or if not found None

### manually adding Hubs

If you want to add a new Hub to a graph without building use this:

```python
def addHub(self, hub: Hub):
```

This will add your Hub to the garph and if its already present it will fail silently

### args

- hub: Hub = the Hub you want to add

---
---

### advanced options

#### swap distance method

When your dataset comes with neither distances nor a coordinate system in degrees you can mount your own distance function. This way you will still be able to build the default driving edges etc.

#### example

```python
from multimodalrouter import RouteGraph
import types
# define your own distance metric (NOTE the arguments must be the same as here)
def myDistancMetric(self, hub1: list[Hub], hub2: list[Hub]):
    ... # here you could for example calculate the euclidean distance
    return distances # np.array or list

# create a normal graph object 
specialGraph = RouteGraph(**kwargs)
# swap the distance method
specialGraph._hubToHubDistances = types.MethodType(myDistanceMetric, specialGraph)
# continue as you would normally
graph.build()
```

#### NOTES

- Naturally you can do the same thing for the preprocessor to calculate the transport mode based distances in the preprocessessing step.

#### higher dimensional graphs

To build graphs from higher dimensional data a few things have to be done differently. As an example I will use the following datasets

| source | destination | sdim1 | sdim2 | sdim3 | ddim1 | ddim2 | ddim3 | distance |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| A      | B           | 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 2     | 2     | 3        |
| C      | A           | 2     | 4     | 4     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 6        |
| B      | C           | 1     | 2     | 2     | 2     | 4     | 4     | 3        |

| source | destination | adim1 | adim2 | adim3 | bdim1 | bdim2 | bdim3 | distance |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| a | b | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 5 |
| a | c | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 4 |
| c | b | 0 | 4 | 0 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 3 |

With these tow 3D datasets you can build a graph as follows:

```python
sourceKeys = ['sdim1', 'sdim2', 'sdim3', 'adim1', 'adim2', 'adim3']
destinationKexs = ['ddim2', 'ddim2', 'ddim3', 'bdim1', 'bdim2', 'bdim3']

from multimodalrouter import RouteGraph

# create a graph

nDimGraph = RouteGraph(
    maxDistance = 3,
    transportModes = {
        'T1': 'mode1',
        'T2': 'mode2'
    },
    dataPaths = {
        'T1': path1, # path to the data from 1st table
        'T2': path2 # path to the data from 2nd table
    },
    drivingEnabled = False, # add your own driving func to enable this
    sourceCoordKeys = sourceKeys, # the keys from the sources
    destCoordKeys = destinationKeys, # the kexs from the destinations
)
```

> Now everything else works as normal but with three coordinates 

#### Notes:

> To enable driving add your own distance function like [this](#swap-distance-method)

> It is theoretically possible to combine hubs from differnt dimensions as long as a distance metric is given or the distance is pre calculated

#### custom filters in searches

To add custom rulesets to searches like [`find_shortest_path`](#routing--finding-the-shortest-path-form-a-to-b) you can add your own [`Filter`](#filter) objects

#### example

Imagine one of your datasets has the following keys

```csv
source, destination, distance, cost, sx, sy, dx, dy, namex, namey
```

You have now build your graph with the extra keys: `cost`, `namex`,`namey`, and you want to start a shortest path search that excludes edges where `cost` > `C` and the where the destination `namey` = `N`. Additionally you want to exclude a list of `hub Ids` = `I`

**create Filter:**

```python
from multimodalrouter import Filter

class CustomFilter(Filter):

    def __init__(self, C: float, N: str, I: list[str]):
        self.C = C
        self.N = N
        self.I = I

    def filterHub(self, hub: Hub):
        return hub.id not in self.I

    def filterEdge(self, edge: EdgeMetadata):
        return (edge.getMetric('cost') < self.C 
                and egde-getMetric('namey') != self.N
               )
```

**use filter**

```python
# graph creation code here

route = graph.find_shortest_path(
    **kwargs,
    custom_filter=CustomFilter(c, n, i) # your filter instance
)
```
---
---
---

## Dataclasses

### Hub

Hubs are the nodes of the [RouteGraph](#routegraph) and store all outgoing connections alongside the relevant [EdgeMetadata](#edgemetadata)

```python
def __init__(
    self, 
    coords: list[float], 
    id: str, 
    hubType: str
):
```

#### fields

- coords: list[float]: the coordinates of the `Hub`. (NOTE: this can be any ndim coordinate aslong as it fits with the rest)
- id: str = a string id like iata code UNLOCODE or whatever you want (NOTE: must be unique for the hubType)
- hubType: str = the type of hub this will be (e.g. `airport`, `trainstation`,...)

#### adding edges

```python
def addOutgoing(
    self, 
    mode: str, 
    dest_id: str, 
    metrics: EdgeMetadata):
```

#### args

- mode: str = the mode of transport along this edge (e.g. `plane`, `car`,...)
- dest_id: str = the id of the destination Hub
- metrics: [EdgeMetadata](#edgemetadata) = the edge object that stores the metrics for this connection

#### getting the edge metrics 

Get the edgeMetadata from this Hub to another, with a given transport mode

```python
def getMetrics(
    self, 
    mode: str, 
    dest_id: str
)-> EdgeMetadata:
```

#### args 

- mode: str = the mode of transport along the edge
- dest_id: str = the id of the destination Hub

**returns:** the edgeMetadata or None if this edge doesn't exist

---
---
### EdgeMetadata

These objects store data about one edge such as the `transport mode` and metrics like `distance` etc.

```python
def __init__(
    self, 
    transportMode: str = None, 
    **metrics):
```

#### args

- transportMode: str = the transpot mode across this edge
- **metrics: dict = a dictionary of edge metrics like `distance`, `time` etc

#### example

create data for an edge that is traversed via `plane`, has a `distance` of `100.0` and `cost` of `250.0`

```python
edgeData = EdgeMetadata(
    transportMode = 'plane',
    **{'distance': 100.0, 'cost': '250.0'}
)
```

#### get a specific metric

```python
def getMetric(
    self,
    metric: OptimizationMetric | str
):
```

#### args

- metric: str = the name of the metric you want to retrieve

---
---

### Route

A dataclass to store all route related data; like Hubs and edges.


#### fields

```python
path: list[tuple[str, str]]
totalMetrics: EdgeMetadata
optimizedMetric: OptimizationMetric
```


#### properties
---

```
@property
    def flatPath(
        self, 
        toStr=True):
```

By calling `route.flatPath` you will get the string representation of the route 

#### example output

> NOTE: this is a verbose route from `-1.680000, 29.258334` to `3.490000, 35.840000`, connected through airports with data from [open flights](https://openflights.org/data.php)

```text
Start: GOM
        Edge: (transportMode=plane, metrics={'distance': 85.9251874180552})
-> BKY
        Edge: (transportMode=drive, metrics={'distance': np.float32(20.288797)})
-> KME
        Edge: (transportMode=plane, metrics={'distance': 147.44185301830063})
-> KGL
        Edge: (transportMode=plane, metrics={'distance': 757.9567739118678})
-> NBO
        Edge: (transportMode=plane, metrics={'distance': 515.1466233682448})
-> LOK
``` 

#### Route To Graph

```python
def asGraph(self, graph):
```

#### args:

* graph: [RouteGraph](#routegraph) = The graph instance that created this route

#### returns:

* [RouteGraph](#routegraph) = a graph with only the nodes from the route

**NOTES** if the given graph is missing some hubs from the route the created graph will skip the missing hubs and include new edges to connect the present hubs. (The new edges will only include the `distance` metric, which is calculated by the passed graph's distance function)

### Filter 

The `Filter` class is an abstract class you can implement to add custom filter to you searches

#### example

```python
class ExampleFilter(Filter):

    def __init__(
        self, 
        forbiddenHubs: list[str], 
        filterVal: str | float
    ):
        self.forbiddenHubs = forbiddenHubs
        self.filterVal = filterVal

    def filterHub(self, hub: Hub) -> bool:
        return hub.id not in self.forbiddenHubs

    def filterEdge(self, edge: EdgeMetadata) -> bool:
        return edge.getMetric('distance') < 3 and edge.getMetric('yourCustomMetric') != self.filterVal
```

This `ExampleFilter` will remove all hubs with Ids in the forbidden hubs list and ignore all edges where: $distance > 3 \lor customMetric = filterVal $

To make your own `Filter` just implement the ``__init__``, `filterHUb` & `filterEdge` functions and pass an object to the search (custom_filter = your flter object)

> Tipp: if you want to only add a filter for either Hubs or Edges set the function that shouldn't filter to return `True`

**example**
```python
def filterHub(self, hub: Hub) -> bool:
    return True
```

will let any hub pass through the filter
