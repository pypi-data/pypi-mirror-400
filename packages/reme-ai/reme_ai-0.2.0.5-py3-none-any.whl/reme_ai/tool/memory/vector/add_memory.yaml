tool: |
  Add a memory to the vector store for future retrieval.
  Use this tool to store important information that should be remembered, such as:
  - Meta information: "I am very happy"
  - Personal preferences: "John prefers dark mode", "Alice works in PST timezone"
  - Procedural knowledge: "To deploy, run build then push", "Always validate input before processing"
  - Tool usage tips: "search_tool works best with short queries", "Use cache tool for frequently accessed data"

tool_multiple: |
  Add multiple memories to the vector store for future retrieval.
  Use this tool to store multiple pieces of important information in a single operation.
  Each memory can include when_to_use conditions and metadata for better organization and retrieval.
  Examples: storing multiple user preferences, multiple procedural steps, or multiple tool usage tips.

when_to_use: |
  Optional condition description for when to retrieve this memory.
  This field is used for vector embedding to improve retrieval accuracy by providing contextual information.
  Examples:
  - "when user asks about authentication"
  - "when deploying to production"
  - "when using search_tool"
  - "when handling error cases"

memory_content: |
  The content of the memory to store.
  Should be a clear, concise statement that captures the information to remember.
  Keep it focused on a single piece of information for better retrieval accuracy.

metadata: |
  Optional metadata for the memory, providing additional context. Can include:
  - time: The timestamp or date associated with the memory (e.g., "2025-01-06 10:30:00")
  - source: Where this information came from (e.g., "user_input", "documentation", "observation")
  - tags: List of tags for categorization (e.g., ["authentication", "security"])
  - Any other custom key-value pairs relevant to the memory

memories: |
  A list of memory objects to store.
