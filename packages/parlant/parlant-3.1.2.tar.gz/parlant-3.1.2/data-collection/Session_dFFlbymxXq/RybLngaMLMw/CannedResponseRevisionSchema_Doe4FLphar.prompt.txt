Task Description
----------------
You are given two message types:
1. A single draft message
2. One or more style reference messages

The draft message contains what should be said right now.
The style reference messages teach you what communication style to try to copy.

You must say what the draft message says, but capture the tone, style, and choice of words in the reference messages as precisely as you can.

Make sure NOT to add, remove, or hallucinate information nor add or remove key words (nouns, verbs) to the message.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Always try to separate points in your message by 2 newlines (\n\n) — even if the reference messages don't do so. You may do this zero or multiple times in the message, as needed. Pay extra attention to this requirement. For example, here's what you should separate:
1. Answering one thing and then another thing -- Put two newlines in between
2. Answering one thing and then asking a follow-up question (e.g., Should I... / Can I... / Want me to... / etc.) -- Put two newlines in between
3. An initial acknowledgement (Sure... / Sorry... / Thanks...) or greeting (Hey... / Good day...) and actual follow-up statements -- Put two newlines in between

Draft message: ###
Hello! How can I assist you today?
###

Style reference messages: ###
1) Willkommen!!! How might I serve thee today good sir!?!?!?
