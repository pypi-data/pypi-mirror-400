class DynamicMotionMagicExpoTorqueCurrentFOC:
    """
    Requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore;
    Requests Motion Magic® Expo to target a final position using an exponential
    motion profile.  This dynamic request allows runtime changes to the profile kV,
    kA, and (optional) Cruise Velocity.  Users can optionally provide a torque
    current feedforward.
    
    Motion Magic® Expo produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting to
    honor the specified Cruise Velocity (optional) and the mechanism kV and kA. 
    Note that unlike the slot gains, the Expo_kV and Expo_kA parameters are always
    in output units of Volts.
    
    Setting the Cruise Velocity to 0 will allow the profile to run to the max
    possible velocity based on Expo_kV.  This control mode does not use the
    Acceleration or Jerk configs.
    
    Target position can be changed on-the-fly and Motion Magic® will do its best to
    adjust the profile. This control mode is based on torque current, so relevant
    closed-loop gains will use Amperes for the numerator.
    
    :param position: Position to drive toward in rotations.
    :type position: rotation
    :param k_v: Mechanism kV for profiling.  Unlike the kV slot gain, this is always
                in units of V/rps.
                
                This represents the amount of voltage necessary to hold a velocity. 
                In terms of the Motion Magic® Expo profile, a higher kV results in a
                slower maximum velocity.
    :type k_v: volts_per_rotation_per_second
    :param k_a: Mechanism kA for profiling.  Unlike the kA slot gain, this is always
                in units of V/rps².
                
                This represents the amount of voltage necessary to achieve an
                acceleration.  In terms of the Motion Magic® Expo profile, a higher
                kA results in a slower acceleration.
    :type k_a: volts_per_rotation_per_second_squared
    :param velocity: Cruise velocity for profiling.  The signage does not matter as
                     the device will use the absolute value for profile generation. 
                     Setting this to 0 will allow the profile to run to the max
                     possible velocity based on Expo_kV.
    :type velocity: rotations_per_second
    :param feed_forward: Feedforward to apply in torque current in Amperes. This is
                         added to the output of the onboard feedforward terms.
                         
                         User can use motor's kT to scale Newton-meter to Amperes.
    :type feed_forward: ampere
    :param slot: Select which gains are applied by selecting the slot.  Use the
                 configuration api to set the gain values for the selected slot
                 before enabling this feature. Slot must be within [0,2].
    :type slot: int
    :param override_coast_dur_neutral: Set to true to coast the rotor when output is
                                       zero (or within deadband).  Set to false to
                                       use the NeutralMode configuration setting
                                       (default). This flag exists to provide the
                                       fundamental behavior of this control when
                                       output is zero, which is to provide 0A (zero
                                       torque).
    :type override_coast_dur_neutral: bool
    :param limit_forward_motion: Set to true to force forward limiting.  This allows
                                 users to use other limit switch sensors connected
                                 to robot controller.  This also allows use of
                                 active sensors that require external power.
    :type limit_forward_motion: bool
    :param limit_reverse_motion: Set to true to force reverse limiting.  This allows
                                 users to use other limit switch sensors connected
                                 to robot controller.  This also allows use of

    :param ignore_hardware_limits: Set to true to ignore hardware limit switches and
                                   the LimitForwardMotion and LimitReverseMotion
                                   parameters, instead allowing motion.
                                   
                                   This can be useful on mechanisms such as an
                                   intake/feeder, where a limit switch stops motion
                                   while intaking but should be ignored when feeding
                                   to a shooter.
                                   
                                   The hardware limit faults and
                                   Forward/ReverseLimit signals will still report
                                   the values of the limit switches regardless of
                                   this parameter.
    :type ignore_hardware_limits: bool
    :param ignore_software_limits: Set to true to ignore software limits, instead
                                   allowing motion.
                                   
                                   This can be useful when calibrating the zero
                                   point of a mechanism such as an elevator.
                                   
                                   The software limit faults will still report the
                                   values of the software limits regardless of this
                                   parameter.
    :type ignore_software_limits: bool
    :param use_timesync: Set to true to delay applying this control request until a
                         timesync boundary (requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore). This
                         eliminates the impact of nondeterministic network delays in
                         exchange for a larger but deterministic control latency.
                         
                         This requires setting the ControlTimesyncFreqHz config in
