## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are available for the community to use and extend. 

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Pre-requisites

* Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12

## Installation

```shell
pip install evo-data-converters-resqml
```

## RESQML

RESQML is an XML based standard for geoscience data.

Refer here for more information: https://www.energistics.org/resqml-data-standards/

To work with RESQML files [the `resqpy` Python package](https://pypi.org/project/resqpy/) is used.

## Usage

For examples of using this package, see the [Jupyter notebooks.](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-data-converters/tree/main/packages/resqml/samples/convert-resqml)

### Limitations

Processing a large amount of grid data can consume a lot of memory due to the `grid.corner_points` array getting very large.

To protect against this there is a `memory_threshold` setting in [conversion_options.py](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-data-converters/tree/main/packages/resqml/src/evo/data_converters/resqml/importer/conversion_options.py). Grids will only be converted if the estimated size of `grid.corner_points` is less than the threshold. The default is 8 GiB but this can be increased if you have more memory available where the importer is running.

## Code of conduct

We rely on an open, friendly, inclusive environment. To help us ensure this remains possible, please familiarise yourself with our [code of conduct.](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-data-converters/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
