Add amount information to Delivery Slip report. You can select at partner level if
picking list report must be valued or not. If the picking is done it's valued with
quantity done, otherwise the picking is valued with reserved quantity.

Additionally, you can configure each individual picking to be valued or not, regardless
of the partner's configuration. This allows for more flexibility when generating
delivery slips for different purposes or recipients.

Additionally, an extensible "Total Picking" section has been added to the
delivery slip report. This total is displayed only when additional amounts are
applied on top of the standard picking total, allowing downstream modules to
adjust the reported total without altering the base report.
