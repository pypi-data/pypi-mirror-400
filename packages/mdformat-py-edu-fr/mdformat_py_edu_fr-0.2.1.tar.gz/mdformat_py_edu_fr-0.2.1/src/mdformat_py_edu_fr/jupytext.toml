# This file configures which notebook or cell metadata is kept or
# discarded upon saving a file with jupytext / jupyter lab.
#
# - discard jupytext.text_representation.jupytext_version: including
#   the jupytext version in the metadata adds no value and causes
#   conflicts.
#
# - keep learning metadata: this is used in certain notebooks for
#   specifying learning objectives, etc.
#
# - discard cell metadata that describes the transient state of the
#   notebook
#
# - discard editable / deletable metadata: these are to be set
#   automatically upon preparing the student version of the notebooks
