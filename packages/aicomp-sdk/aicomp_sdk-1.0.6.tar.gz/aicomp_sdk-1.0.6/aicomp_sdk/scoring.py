    Attack scoring has two modes:
    1. RAW MODE (legacy): Direct sum of severity weights + novelty bonus
       - Typical range: 20-500 points
       - Creates imbalance with defense scores (0-1000)

    2. NORMALIZED MODE (recommended): Scales to 0-1000 range
       - Baseline attack (~200 raw) -> ~500 normalized
       - Elite attack (~400 raw) -> 1000 normalized
       - Balanced competition with defense scores
