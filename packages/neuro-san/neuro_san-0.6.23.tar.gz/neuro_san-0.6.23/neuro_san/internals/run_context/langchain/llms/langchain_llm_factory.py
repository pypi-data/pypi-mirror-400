class LangChainLlmFactory(EnvironmentConfiguration):
    """
    Interface for Factory classes creating LLM BaseLanguageModels.
    This derives from EnvironmentConfiguration in order to support easy access to
    the get_value_or_env() method.

    Most methods take a config dictionary which consists of the following keys:

        "model_name"                The name of the model.
                                    Default if not specified is "gpt-3.5-turbo"

        "temperature"               A float "temperature" value with which to
                                    initialize the chat model.  In general,
                                    higher temperatures yield more random results.
                                    Default if not specified is 0.7

        "max_tokens"                The maximum number of tokens to use in
                                    get_max_prompt_tokens(). By default this comes from
                                    the model description in this class.

        This method is provided for backwards compatibility.
