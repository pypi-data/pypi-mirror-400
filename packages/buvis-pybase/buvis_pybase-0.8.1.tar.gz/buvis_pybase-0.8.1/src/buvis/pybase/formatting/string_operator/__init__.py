"""StringOperator is the main facade; StringCaseTools handles case conversion helpers
(humanize, camelize, underscore), WordLevelTools manages singularize/pluralize workflows,
Abbr expands abbreviations, and TagSuggester provides NLP-driven tag suggestions.
Typical usage goes through the parent package's exported StringOperator."""
