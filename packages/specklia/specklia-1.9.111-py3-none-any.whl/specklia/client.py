    """
    Client for the Specklia webservice.

    Specklia is a geospatial point cloud database designed for Academic use.
    Further details are available at https://specklia.earthwave.co.uk.

    This object is a Python client for connecting to Specklia's API.

    Giving the value of this object's user_id to another user will allow them to add you to private groups.
    Please quote your user_id when contacting support@earthwave.co.uk.

    Parameters
    ----------
    auth_token : str
        The authentication token to use to authorise calls to Specklia.
        Obtained via https://specklia.earthwave.co.uk.
    url : str
        The url where Specklia is running, by default the URL of the Specklia server.

    Attributes
    ----------
    user_id : str
        The unique ID of the user associated with this client.
    internal_admin : SpeckliaInternalAdminClient
        Contains endpoints only accessible to internal Specklia administrators.

    Examples
    --------
    To start using Specklia, we first need to navigate to https://specklia.earthwave.co.uk and follow the
    instructions to generate a Specklia API key.

    The key should then be kept somewhere safe where only we can access it, and needs to be passed each time we
    instantiate our Specklia client.

    If we save our key to a file, we can then utilise it as such::

        >>> with open("our_auth_token.jwt") as fh:
        ...     user_auth_token = fh.read()
        >>> client = Specklia(auth_token=user_auth_token)

            A dataframe describing users within a group.

        Examples
        --------
        To use this endpoint, we need to be an ADMIN of a group and know its ID.

        By default, we are the ADMIN of our own personal group, the name of which is the same as our user_id, as well

        client.add_user_to_group() and client.update_user_privileges().

        If we know the name of the group but not its ID, we can determine this by calling client.list_groups() and

        We can then run::

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset_id : str
            The UUID of the dataset to query.
        epsg4326_polygon : Union[Polygon, MultiPolygon]
            The geospatial polygon or multipolygon to query.
            Only points within this polygon or multipolygon will be returned.
            The edges of the polygon or multipolygon are interpreted as geodesics on the WGS84 ellipsoid.
            The points must be in the order (longitude, latitude).
        min_datetime : datetime
            The minimum datetime for the query. Only points occurring after this datetime will be returned.
        max_datetime : datetime
            The maximum datetime for the query. Only points occurring before this datetime will be returned.
        columns_to_return : Optional[List[str]]
            A list of dataset columns to return. If None or an empty list, all columns are returned. By default, None.
        additional_filters: Optional[List[Dict[str, Union[float, str]]]]
            Additional filters to apply to the data. These operate on additional rows in the data.
            A list of dicts of the form : {'column': str, 'operator': str, 'threshold': Union[float, str]}, where:

            * 'column' is the name of a column that occurs within the dataset
            * 'operator' is a comparison operator, one of '>', '<', '=', '!=', '>=', '<='
            * 'threshold' is the value the column will be compared against.

            These conditions are applied to the data using logical AND. By default, None.
        source_information_only: bool
            If True, no geodataframe is returned, only the set of unique sources. By default, False

        Returns
        -------
        Tuple[gpd.GeoDataFrame, List[Dict]]
            The data resulting from the query. (only source_ids when source_information_only is True).
            Metadata for the query; a list of sources for the data.

        Examples
        --------
        We can utilise client.list_datasets() to determine which dataset we wish to query and narrow down our
        query parameters. The output from the call will include all the necessary details of a dataset, such as its
        space-time coverage and available columns.

        For example, let's say we have found a dataset which has data in our area of interest in December 2022 and we
        are specifically interested in its 'air_quality' column. We can query this as such::

            >>> from shapely import Polygon
            >>> from datetime import datetime

            >>> query_start_time = datetime(2022, 12, 15)
            >>> query_end_time = datetime(2022, 12, 20)
            >>> query_polygon = Polygon(((-1, -1), (-1, 2), (2, 2), (2, -1), (-1, -1)))

            >>> points, sources = client.query_dataset(dataset_id=dataset_id,
            ...                                        epsg4326_polygon=query_polygonm
            ...                                        min_datetime=query_start_time,
            ...                                        max_datetime=query_end_time,
            ...                                        columns_to_return=['air_quality'],
            ...                                        additional_filters=[])

        We should always pick our query polygon and time window carefully, based on our use-case.

        Where possible, we should also utilise the additional_filters parameter to filter data down further
        before retrieval. For example, if our dataset has a column 'bird_type' and we know we are only interested in
        swallows, we should pass::

            additional_filters=[{'column': 'bird_type', 'operator': '=', 'threshold': 'swallow'}].

        This will ensure fast querying and minimise the amount of data streamed back to our device.

        in the result is described by a group_name and a group_id.

        By default, each user is a member of their personal group, with group_name equal to their user_id, as well the
        special all_users group.

        If we know a group's name but not its ID, we can call client.list_groups() and filter down the results::

            >>> groups_i_belong_to_df = client.list_groups()
            >>> name_of_group_to_find = "university_of_edinburgh"
            >>> desired_group_id = groups_i_belong_to_df[
            ... groups_i_belong_to_df['group_name'] == name_of_group_to_find]['group_id'].iloc[0]

        We can now pass this ID to other Specklia endpoints to modify the group, its members, and datasets.

        We have to ask a user for their ID before we can add them to our group. If they wish to be added, they can

        Update a user's privileges within a particular group.

        You must have ADMIN permissions within the group in order to do this.

        These privileges determine what a user can do with the datasets and users in the group:

        * READ_ONLY means that the user can read the datasets, but cannot write to them, or change properties of the
          group.
        * READ_WRITE means that the user can write to existing datasets as well as read from them, but cannot change the
          properties of the group. Users with READ_WRITE permissions cannot create or destroy whole datasets within a
          group.
        * ADMIN means that the user can add and remove other users from the group, can change their privileges, and can
          add and remove datasets from the group.

        Examples
        --------
        When we use client.add_user_to_group() to add a user to a group of which we are an ADMIN, they
        are automatically given READ_ONLY privileges. This means they can read the group's datasets, but not modify
        them.

        If we wish for the user to be able to add, delete, and modify points in the group's datasets, but not delete
        the datasets themselves, we can give them READ_WRITE privileges::

            >>> client.update_user_privileges(group_id=GROUP_ID,

        Create a dataset.

        Specklia datasets contain point cloud data.
        When you create the dataset, you must specify the fields within the data.

        After you have created the dataset, you'll probably want to add data to it using
        Specklia.add_points_to_dataset().

        When a dataset is first created, it will be owned by a group with its group_name matching your user ID.
        You have ADMIN permissions within this group. In order for other people to access this dataset, you must
        either move it into another group using Specklia.update_dataset_ownership(), or add a user to your
        personal group using Specklia.add_user_to_group().

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset_name : str
            The name the user provides for the dataset.
            Must contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, underscores and hyphens only.
        description : str
            A description of the dataset.
            Must contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, underscores and hyphens only.
        columns : Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]]
            A list where each item is an additional column the user wishes to add to the dataset,
            beyond the mandatory EPSG4326 latitude, longitude and POSIX timestamp.
            A list of columns should follow the format::

                [{'name': 'elevation', 'type': 'float', 'description': 'elevation', 'unit': 'metres'},
                {'name': 'remarks', 'type': 'str', 'description': 'per-row remarks', 'unit': 'NA'}]

            Where valid values for 'type' are 'string', 'float', 'int', and 'polygon' and the other three fields are
            strings, which must contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, underscores and hyphens only.

            When using 'type': 'polygon', the column must be a GeoPandas GeoSeries containing shapely Polygon objects
            in EPSG4326 using the Point(lon, lat) convention.

            Please do not create explicit EPSG4326 columns (e.g. 'lat', 'lon') or POSIX timestamp columns
            as these are unnecessary repetitions of Specklia default columns.
        storage_technology : str
            Determines the storage technology used for the dataset, by default 'OLAP'.
            This cannot be changed after the dataset is created.
            Can start with either 'OLAP', meaning Online Analysis Processing, or 'OLTP',
            meaning Online Transaction Processing.
            Selecting 'OLAP' will make your data storage cheaper,
            but at the cost of queries returning in seconds to tens of seconds.
            Selecting 'OLTP' will make your data storage more expensive,
            but queries will return in hundreds of milliseconds to a second.
            In addition, you can specify chunked OLTP storage by specifying a storage_technology
            in the following format: 'OLTP_tHHHHH_sII'. This option can be used to deliver faster query speeds
            for larger OLTP datasets (more than a million rows).
            When specifying a chunked storage technology, HHHHH is the zero-padded number of hours within
            a single chunk, while II is the s2 indexing level at which chunks will be split
            (see http://s2geometry.io/resources/s2cell_statistics for more detail).
            As an example, 'OLTP_t00720_s06' refers to a storage technology where the chunks span 30 days
            and approximately 100km.
            For more guidance on selecting a chunked storage technology, email support@earthwave.co.uk

        Returns
        -------
        str
            The unique ID of the newly created dataset.

        Examples
        --------
        To create a dataset, we must choose a name, and then provide a description and a list of all of its columns
        beyond 'lat', 'lon', and 'time'. For example::

            >>> client.create_dataset(
            ...     dataset_name='my_air_dataset',
            ...     description='Dataset containing air quality measurements gathered for Stop Pollution project',

            dataset_id

        The above has created a new dataset, by default owned by our personal group - the group whose name matches our
        user ID.  We can use the returned dataset_id to write data to the dataset with client.add_points_to_dataset()
        or move it to another group through client.update_dataset_ownership().

        If nothing is passed to the optional parameter 'columns', the created dataset will only have three columns: lat,
        long, and time.
