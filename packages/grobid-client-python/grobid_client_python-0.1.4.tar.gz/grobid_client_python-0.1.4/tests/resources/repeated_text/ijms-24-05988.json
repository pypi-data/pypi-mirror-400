        "text": "Several studies have linked bad prognoses of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to the ability of leukemic cells to reprogram their metabolism and, in particular, their lipid metabolism. In this context, we performed \"in-depth\" characterization of fatty acids (FAs) and lipid species in leukemic cell lines and in plasma from AML patients. We firstly showed that leukemic cell lines harbored significant differences in their lipid profiles at steady state, and that under nutrient stress, they developed common mechanisms of protection that led to variation in the same lipid species; this highlights that the remodeling of lipid species is a major and shared mechanism of adaptation to stress in leukemic cells. We also showed that sensitivity to etomoxir, which blocks fatty acid oxidation (FAO), was dependent on the initial lipid profile of cell lines, suggesting that only a particular \"lipidic phenotype\" is sensitive to the drug targeting of FAO. We then showed that the lipid profiles of plasma samples from AML patients were significantly correlated with the prognosis of patients. In particular, we highlighted the impact of phosphocholine and phosphatidyl-choline metabolism on patients' survival. In conclusion, our data show that balance between lipid species is a phenotypic marker of the diversity of leukemic cells that significantly influences their proliferation and resistance to stress, and thereby, the prognosis of AML patients.",

      "text": "AML comprises a group of malignant neoplastic disorders characterized by accumulation in the blood and/or in the bone marrow of immature white blood cells called leukemic cells, together with a deficiency in normal hematopoiesis. If conventional treatment based on intensive chemotherapy allows complete remission for 60 to 85% of patients, the prognosis of AML remains very negative, with a global survival rate of around 25 to 30%. In recent years, several studies linked this aggressiveness and the bad prognosis of AML to the ability of the leukemic cells to reprogram their metabolism in order to satisfy their high metabolic needs and to resist chemotherapy. In addition to the universally known Warburg effect, which involves a shift from oxidative phosphorylation as the main energy-producing pathway to high-rate aerobic glycolysis coupled with lactic acid fermentation in the cytosol, many metabolic pathways are deregulated in leukemic cells, sometimes in direct correlation with genetic alterations [1]; this suggests multimodal metabolism in leukemogenesis. Among these metabolic pathways, lipid metabolism plays a particular role that has already been described in many solid tumors. Alterations, such as accentuated FAO and de novo lipid synthesis, could promote cancer cell survival and contribute to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and metastasis [2] through an increase in energy production and in lipid species necessary for the production of new cells. The overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) gives cancer cells a proliferative advantage; conversely, lipolysis, through the activation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), could increase the availability of FAs to levels necessary for cancer cell proliferation.",

      "text": "In AML, a recent study showed that patients with rapidly progressive AML who did not respond to treatment had alterations in their lipid metabolism [3]. Interestingly, both aspects of lipid metabolism were implicated. On one hand, the degradation of FA through FAO may contribute to chemotherapy resistance. Indeed, resistant AML cells show overexpression of CD36, an FA transporter, at their membranes, and very intense FAO. This particular role of FAO in the survival of leukemic cells was also underlined in a demonstration of the overexpression of the enzyme 3-very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) in AML, of which a decrease in proliferation can be induced by gene attenuation or pharmacological inhibition via alteration of the Krebs cycle [4]. Additionally, a recent study demonstrated that glycerophospholipid metabolism is involved in drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia through downregulation of the G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2), which confers worse overall survival to patients [5]. Similarly, Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), a key enzyme in carnitine-dependent transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane of FAs, was found to be overexpressed in bone marrow samples from AML patients with poor prognosis compared to those with normal bone marrow [6]. These data provide a rationale for studying the impact of etomoxir (Eto), which irreversibly inhibits CPT1A, thereby preventing the entrance of fatty acids into the mitochondria, and their beta-oxidation.",

It was shown that low expression of ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL), the enzyme that initiates lipid synthesis through Acetyl-CoA production, is associated with favorable prognosis in patients with AML, and that discontinuation of cell growth was achieved when ACL was inhibited in leukemia cell models [7]. Similarly, an anti-leukemic role of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1 (ACC1), the enzyme that catalyzes the production of Malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, has been shown [8].",

Indeed, significant differences concerning modulation of the synthesis of ceramides and sphingolipids have been highlighted in patients presenting with t(8;21) compared to those presenting with an inv (16) or a normal karyotype [9]. Additionally, Stuani et al. compared the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in a cellular model of AML mutated for the IDH1 gene to that in a non-mutated model [10]. These differences are mainly characterized by an increase in phosphatidylinositol, sphingolipids, free cholesterol and monounsaturated fatty acids in IDH-mutated cells. This, again, highlights the impact of the cytogenetic characteristics and mutational status of AML patients on cellular metabolism. Finally, a recent study showed a decrease in total FAs in the plasma of patients with AML, as well as the attenuation of plasmatic phosphocholine, triglycerides and cholesterol esters [11]. In addition, arachidonic acid appears to be increased in AML plasma samples, suggesting its involvement in the cancerous phenotype [12].",

For this first set of experiments, we evaluated, based on data from the literature, two concentrations of Eto: 200 and 400 µM, respectively. As shown in Figure 3A,B, the percentage of viable cells decreased significantly in both cell lines with dose and time, demonstrating a dose-and time-dependent inhibitory effect of Eto on these leukemic cells. However, the sensitivity levels of the two cell lines were significantly different. The percentage of viable K562 cells after 24 h and 48 h of treatment with Eto was significantly more decreased compared to that of KG1 cells, showing that K562 was more sensitive to the action of Eto than KG1. The calculated IC 50 values of etomoxir were 113.7 µM and 320 µM for K562 and KG1, respectively, confirming their differences in sensitivity.",

Our first results show that, in their basic state, the five leukemic cell lines, which were representative of a certain diversity of AML, were characterized by very different total quantities of fatty acids, with a ratio of 1 to 7 between the K562 (the highest) and HL60 (the lowest) cell lines. To further characterize the relative proportion of fatty acids and lipid species, independently of the initial quantity of fatty acids, we chose to analyze K562 and KG1, which presented very different levels of FAs at baseline, suggesting very different lipids compositions. In fact, the qualitative analysis of their lipid contents showed very clear differences in the relative proportion of lipid species, demonstrating the diversity of the lipidome of leukemic cells. These results show that, in accordance with the results that we have previously published on the HRMAS profiles of these cell lines [18], there are clear differences in the expression levels of metabolites between leukemic cell lines. The most probable hypothesis is a direct link between the metabolic profile and the genetic status of leukemic cells, as has already been shown in patients with t(8;21), inv(16) or IDH mutation [9,10].",

Regarding the lipid level, the first indicator of this adaptation was a significant decrease in their overall level of fatty acids after 48 h of serum deficiency, suggesting that the \"basic quantitative reserves\" of lipids in the cells are, in themselves, a protective mechanism. A decrease in lipid storage, such as DAG/cholesterol and TAG/cholesteryl ester, can also be attributed to the mobilization of lipids for survival. Interestingly, we observed significant variation in the lipid species that showed many similarities between the two cell lines, suggesting that under this stress condition, the leukemic cells set up common pathways, independently of the differences observed in their basal state. In particular, we observed a decrease in phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, which suggests that leukemic cells use phosphatidyl-choline and its substrates to survive. The deregulation of phosphatidyl-choline metabolism has been described in many cancers [19]. Several papers have noted changes in phosphatidyl-choline levels in cancers, particularly those of the prostate, ovaries and lung [20,21]. Similarly, the dysregulation of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and phosphatidyl-inositol has been reported in prostate cancer. Moreover, Zheng et al. showed that under serum deprivation, human breast cancer cells exhibited increased phospholipase D (PLD) activity, leading to a decrease in (P)C (via the activation of its catabolism) and increased migration and metastasis potential [22]. We also observed a significant decrease in arachidonic acid, high levels of which have been described in AML patients with a poor prognosis [11]. Hence, our results show, for the first time, and to our knowledge, that the remodeling of lipid species is a major and shared mechanism of adaptation to stress in leukemic cells. This role was highlighted in the mechanism of sensitivity of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) containing phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (HUFA-(P)E), such as those found in salmon testes, significantly enhanced dbcAMP-induced cell differentiation [23]. This effect was suppressed by a protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting that HUFA-(P)E might enhance dbcAMP-induced differentiation through the modulation of the protein kinase C signaling pathway in HL60 cells.",

In the presence of Eto, we observed a decrease in viability time and dose dependence in both cell lines, which increased dramatically in the absence of serum. However, sensitivity to Eto was significantly different between the two cell lines. The seahorse analysis of mitochondrial respiration demonstrated that in both cell lines, Eto-by inhibiting FAO-definitively reduces ATP production, even though KG1 was less impacted than K562, which was consistent with what we observed regarding viability.",

On one hand, K562 cells, with a dose close to their IC 50 value, present a blockade of the use of most of their fatty acids (in coherence with the mechanism of action of etomoxir), since their rates and relative proportions show very few differences compared to their basal profiles. In addition, no modification of the lipid species was observed in this cell line, suggesting that the blockade of FAO actually induced the death of K562 cells. Conversely, the KG1 cells, which are resistant to a dose of 100 µM of Eto (IC 50 = 320 µM), showed very significant variations (p < 0.001) in the rates and relative proportions of several fatty acids. This decrease in the presence of Eto, which blocks FAO, together with the resistance of KG1 cells to etomoxir, suggests that KG1 cells have developed a mechanism of resistance against Eto that involves certain FAs and/or storage lipids. We can hypothesize that these lipid species are used for the renewal of new leukemic cells through their structural role, but also that they could be implicated in mechanism of drug resistance. Indeed, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis was shown to regulate drug sensitivity in clinically relevant models of drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemias, through modulation of both the expression and activity of the drug efflux proteins ABCB1 and ABCC1 [25].",

Therefore, the targeting of lipid metabolism should be proposed only for a subset of AML patients who display a sensitive \"lipidic phenotype\".",

      "text": "Leukemic cell lines represent a questionable model of what happens in patients. This is why we reinforced the in vitro analysis with an ex vivo analysis of patient samples, in order to assess the role of the patients' lipidome on their survival. We firstly compared total fatty acids, phospholipids and neutral lipids among a cohort of 39 AML patients with high (n = 21) or low (n = 18) prognoses (according to ELN 2017 [17]). In addition, as all investigations of lipid species (FA and phospholipid composition) using LC-MS and GC-MS are very time-consuming experiences, require very high-level expertise and could not be carried out on large series of patients, we further selected five patients belonging to the high or low prognostic subgroups, respectively, for extensive lipidome analysis. Although this number of patients may seem low (n = 10, 5 patients in each group), to our knowledge, this type of characterization of the lipidome in samples from AML patients has never before been published. In addition, the number of independent measurements for this type of assay is classically n = 3m and in our case, we had five independent values for each parameter; this gives statistical significance to our results, which are quite robust.",

      "text": "We found an increase in the quantity of neutral lipids (FFAs), which are storage lipids, in patients with an unfavorable prognosis, suggesting that the mobilization of these storage lipids improve the viability of leukemic cells. Moreover, the increase in the quantity of phospholipids, and in particular, of sphingomyelin and phosphocholine (PC), in patients with an unfavorable prognosis confirms that PLs are markers of aggressiveness and tumor progression, which are associated with a poor prognosis in AML. These results are consistent with those described in cancers [26,27]. Elevated levels of PC indicate intense cell proliferation, commonly observed in cancers, in association with an increase in phosphoethanolamine (PE) [26]. At the neurological level, two studies have shown that patients with a low-grade glioma that progressed to a high-grade glioma had much higher levels of PC and PE [28,29]. Similarly, Wang et al. observed that PC was expressed at a higher level in the sera of patients with an intermediate prognosis compared to patients with a favorable prognosis. This is in line with an unfavorable impact of PC on prognosis [30]. The fact that we observed, in a previous study, that an increase in PC was a common mechanism of survival against starvation in leukemic cell lines [18] strongly suggests that its prognostic role in patients could be explained by a \"protective\" role of PC, which could increase the resistance of leukemic cells in stressful situations. It is very interesting to note that in this study, we observed a decrease in phosphatidyl-choline in a situation of metabolic stress in our cell lines. Taking into account that the catabolism of phosphatidyl-choline can produce phosphocholine, we can hypothesize that leukemic cells use phosphatidyl-choline catabolism to generate lipid mediators that will increase their survival. Moreover, a team recently created an inventory of lipidome in the plasma of patients with AML, and showed a decrease in total FFAs, including PC; this was probably be due to increased oxidation of FAs in AML cells. Altogether, these data underline the crucial role of phosphatidyl-choline and phosphocholine metabolism in the survival of leukemic cells, suggesting that it could be also an interesting therapeutic target.",
