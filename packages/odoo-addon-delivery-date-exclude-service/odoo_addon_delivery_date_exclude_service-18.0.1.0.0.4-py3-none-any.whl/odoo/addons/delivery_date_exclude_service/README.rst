This module provides granular control over which service products impact
the calculated expected delivery date on a Sales Order.

It works by directly filtering out the lead times from specific service
lines before the final delivery date is determined.

1. New Field: A boolean field named "Affect Delivery Date" is added to
   the product template ("Sales" tab, "Extra Info" section). It is
   visible only for products of type ``service``.
2. **Exclusion:** When a Sale Order line contains a Service Product
   where the "Affect Delivery Date" flag is unchecked:

   - The line's lead time is ignored.
   - This ensures the service product's delay is completely excluded
     from the final order date calculation.

3. **Inclusion:** All other products (Physical Goods, and Services with
   the flag checked) contribute their standard lead time to the final
   delivery date.

Configuration
=============

To make use of this feature, you only need to configure products of type
``service`` that you want to impact the delivery date.

1. Navigate to "Inventory > Products > Products".
2. Select the "Service" type product you wish to configure.
3. Switch to the "Sales" tab.
4. Check the "Affect Delivery Date" boolean field in the "Extra Info"
   section.

..

   **Note:** By default all Service products are set to to NOT affect
   the Sales Order delivery date computation.
