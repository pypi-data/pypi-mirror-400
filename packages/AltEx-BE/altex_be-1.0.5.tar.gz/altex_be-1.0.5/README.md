## Overview

**AltEx-BE** is a command-line bioinformatics tool that designs sgRNAs (single guide RNAs) to induce targeted exon skipping using Base Editing technology.

Manipulating alternative splicing is key to understanding diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, but designing the right tools for the job is a major bottleneck. The manual process of identifying targetable exons, designing sgRNAs for specific base editors, and assessing off-target risks is complex, tedious, and slows down critical research.

**AltEx-BE** is a powerful command-line tool built to automate this entire workflow. It intelligently parses transcript data to find the best exon targets, designs candidates for a multitude of base editors, and evaluates their off-target risk to provide a ranked list of high-confidence sgRNAs.

By transforming a complex, multi-step design process into a single command, AltEx-BE bridges the gap between your scientific question and a successful wet lab experiment, significantly accelerating research into splicing-related diseases and therapies.


## Key Features

- 🧬 **Automated Target Exon Annotation**: 
    - Automatically parses transcript structures from refFlat files to identify and classify potential targets for exon skipping. This includes Skipped Exons (SE) and exons with Alternative 3'/5' Splice Sites (A3SS/A5SS), eliminating the need for tedious manual searches.

- ⚙️ **Universal Base Editor Compatibility**: 
    - Supports virtually any ABE or CBE. You can use built-in presets or define any custom editor by specifying its PAM sequence and editing window, allowing immediate use of the latest editors from new publications. 
    - AltEx-BE can design sgRNAs for multiple Base-Editors in one run

- 🚀 **Streamlined End-to-End Workflow**:
    - Seamlessly moves from data input to candidate selection. The design command generates sgRNAs, while the visualize command creates comprehensive reports to help you evaluate and rank the best candidates for your experiment.

## Installation

To get started with AltEx-BE, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```sh
# 1. install via bioconda
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda altex-be

# 2. install via pypi
pip install AltEx-BE
```
## Required dataset
To use AltEx-BE, you should prepare 2 input files in your computer
- refFlat file or gtf file of your interest species   
    - refflat file contains Refseq infomations: explanation of refFlat format is [here](https://genome.bio.fsu.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?hgsid=235697_cnEhDmy3qVsShD0gwzprkJveBQah&hgta_doSchemaDb=mm39&hgta_doSchemaTable=refFlat)   
    - you can download refflat files from  UCSC goldenpath: refflat files of mm39 is [here](https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/mm39/database/)
    - also you can use GTF file as a input
      - If you use GTF, AltEx-BE automatically converts GTF into refflat format and generate them into output directory
- Fasta files contain all chromosome sequence of your interest species
    - you can download Fasta file also from UCSC goldenpath
    - please comfirm your .fa files contain all of chromosome. if not, AltEx-BE process will fail
- (optional) CSV or TXT or TSV contain the gene symbols or Refseq IDs
    - AltEx-BE is avalilable for many genes. When you want to design sgRNAs for many genes, You can input gene list via `--gene-file` option. 
    - The input file should only have 1 column with gene symbols or refseq IDs (No need the header row) 

> [!NOTE]
> **Point of Gene and RefseqID input**
> - When providing a gene symbol (e.g., MYGENE), AltEx-BE will analyze all known transcripts of that gene to identify alternative splicing events.
> - When providing a RefSeq ID (e.g., NM_0012345), AltEx-BE will automatically identify the corresponding gene and analyze all of its transcripts. This ensures a comprehensive analysis even when starting from a single transcript identifier.

## Usage & Quick example

AltEx-BE is operated via the `altex-be` command.

#### 1. Using a Preset Editor:
- By default, AltEx-BE design sgRNAs for below 6 Base Editing Tools

> [!NOTE]
> **Preset Base Editors:**

```sh
altex-be \
    --refflat-path /path/to/your/refFlat.txt \
    --fasta-path /path/to/your/genome.fa \
    --output-dir /path/to/output_directory \
    --gene-symbols MYGENE \
    --assembly-name hg38
```

#### 2. Input Base Editor Information in the Command Line:

```sh
altex-be \
    --refflat-path /path/to/your/refFlat.txt \
    --fasta-path /path/to/your/genome.fa \
    --output-dir /path/to/output_directory \
    --gene-symbols MYGENE \
    --assembly-name hg38 \
    --be-name target-aid \
    --be-type cbe \
    --be-pam NGG \
    --be-start 17 \
    --be-end 19
```

> [!CAUTION]
> `--be-start` and `--be-end` specify the editing window of your base editor. The location of the editing window is counted from the base next to the PAM (1-indexed).

#### 3. Input a CSV/TSV/TXT File Containing Information about Your Base Editors:

You can provide a file containing the information for one or more base editors. This is useful when you want to design sgRNAs for multiple editors at once.

> [!CAUTION]
> The input file should have the following columns: `base_editor_name`, `pam_sequence`, `editing_window_start`, `editing_window_end`, `base_editor_type`.

```sh
altex-be \
    --refflat-path /path/to/your/refFlat.txt \
    --fasta-path /path/to/your/genome.fa \
    --output-dir /path/to/output_directory \
    --gene-symbols MYGENE \
    --assembly-name hg38 \
    --be-files /path/to/your/base_editor_info.csv
```
