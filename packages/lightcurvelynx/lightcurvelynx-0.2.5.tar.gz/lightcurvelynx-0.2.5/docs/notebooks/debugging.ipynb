    "# Debugging Simulations and Models\n",
    "\n",
    "LightCurveLynx provides a variety of tools to help users understand what is happening within a simulation and how a model is working. This notebook provides an overview of some of the common approaches a user can employ to investigate model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The GraphState\n",
    "\n",
    "LightCurveLynx uses a `GraphState` object to store all of the information about the sampled parameters. These saved values include not only the settings of the physical object being simulated, such as its redshift, but also parameters of prior distributions and internal bookkeeping values. Thus it is a good place to inspect what is happening at different stages of your parameter graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can think of the `GraphState` as a nested dictionary where parameters are indexed by two levels. In the first level, the node label tells the code which object the parameter belongs to. This level of identification is necessary to allow different stages to use parameters with the same name. If we are blending many objects, we could have different RA values for each of the sources. In the second level of the `GraphState`, the parameter name maps to the actual sampled values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, let’s look at a static object with a random parameter for brightness that is the sum of randomly chosen object brightness and background brightness."

The second level node simply adds the two nodes together to produce a `total_brightness` function. The final node creates a constant SED model with the given brightness. Thus the realized brightness of the sampled object will depend on a chain of nodes and two randomly sampled parameters."
