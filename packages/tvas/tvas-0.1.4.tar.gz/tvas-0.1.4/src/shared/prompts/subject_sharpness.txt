Look at this cropped image of the {primary_subject}. Analyze the sharpness and focus of the subject.
Classify the blur level as one of the following:
- "SHARP": The subject is sharp and in focus.  This image can go on a postcard.
- "MINOR_BLURRY": The subject has some motion blur or is slightly out of focus, but still recognizable.
- "VERY_BLURRY": The subject is completely out of focus, blurry, or unrecognizable.

If the image is not SHARP, identify the type of blur:
- "MOTION": Blur caused by subject movement or camera shake.
- "FOCUS": Blur caused by missed focus (focus is in front or behind the subject).
- "N/A": If the image is SHARP.

Answer with a JSON object: {{"blur_level": "SHARP" | "MINOR_BLURRY" | "VERY_BLURRY", "blur_type": "MOTION" | "FOCUS" |  "N/A"}}.
