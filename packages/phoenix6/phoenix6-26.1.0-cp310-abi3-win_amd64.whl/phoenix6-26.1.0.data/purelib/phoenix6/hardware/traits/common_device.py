        Optimizes the device's bus utilization by reducing the

        All status signals that have not been explicitly gven an
        update frequency using BaseStatusSignal.set_update_frequency

        in the robot program. Additionally, this method does not
        necessarily need to be called after setting the update
        frequencies of other signals.

        To restore the default status update frequencies, call
        reset_signal_frequencies. Alternatively, remove this method
        call, redeploy the robot application, and power-cycle the
        device on the bus. The user can also override individual
