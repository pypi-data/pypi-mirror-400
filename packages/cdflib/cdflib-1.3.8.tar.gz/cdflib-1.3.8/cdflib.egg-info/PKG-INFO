# CDFlib

`cdflib` is a python module to read/write CDF (Common Data Format `.cdf`) files without needing to install the
[CDF NASA library](https://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

Python >= 3.9 is required.
The core of this package uses only numpy, with no complicated compiler requirements.

## Install

To install, open up your terminal/command prompt, and type:
```sh
pip install cdflib
```
