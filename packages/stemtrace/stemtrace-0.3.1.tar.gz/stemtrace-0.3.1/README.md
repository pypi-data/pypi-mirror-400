> **Flower shows you what exists. Stemtrace shows you what happened.**

Ever stared at a failed Celery task wondering "what called this?" or "why did it retry 5 times?"

Stemtrace captures your task executions as a graph — visualize parent→child flows, see retry chains, track groups and chords, all without adding any new infrastructure.

**stemtrace supports Redis and RabbitMQ** for event transport.

## ✨ Features

**See What Happened**
- **Task Flow Graphs** — Visualize chains, groups, and chords as interactive DAGs
- **Execution Timeline** — Track queued → started → retried → finished states
- **Arguments & Results** — Inspect inputs, outputs, and exceptions
- **Retry Chains** — Understand exactly when and why retries happened

**Canvas Support**
- **Groups & Chords** — Automatic visualization of `group()` and `chord()` patterns
- **Parent-Child Tracking** — See which task spawned which

**Worker Monitoring & Registry**
- **Workers page** — See which workers are online/offline and what tasks they have registered
- **Registry status badges** — Quickly spot tasks that are active, never run, or not registered by any current worker

**Production Ready**
- **Zero Infrastructure** — Uses your existing broker (Redis or RabbitMQ), no database needed
- **Sensitive Data Scrubbing** — Passwords and API keys filtered automatically
- **Read-Only** — Safe for production; never modifies your task queue
- **FastAPI Integration** — Mount into your existing app with one line

## 🔎 What you’ll see in the dashboard

### Task details (timing, inputs/outputs, errors)

- **What you’ll see**: Per-task execution timing (including how long it spent in each state), parameters (args/kwargs), return value, and the full event history.
- **Why it helps**: Quickly answer “what happened?” for a single task: slow queueing vs slow execution, which retry succeeded, and (on failures) the exception + traceback for debugging.

</p>

### Flow graphs (chains, groups, chords)

- **What you’ll see**: An interactive DAG of your workflow with parent→child edges, plus clear GROUP/CHORD containers for Celery canvas patterns.
- **Why it helps**: Understand fan-out/fan-in at a glance (especially chords), spot which branch failed, and debug “why didn’t my callback run?” without grepping logs.

  <img src="docs/screenshots/workflow.png" width="900" alt="Chord visualization in the workflow graph" />
</p>

### Task registry (registration status + warnings)

- **What you’ll see**: A registry of tasks with status badges like **Active**, **Never Run**, and **Not Registered** plus “registered by …” worker info.
- **Why it helps**: Catch misconfigurations where tasks get stuck in **PENDING** because no current worker has the task registered (common in multi-repo or deploy drift scenarios).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Using pip
pip install stemtrace

# Using uv
uv add stemtrace
```


### 2. Instrument your Celery app

```python
from celery import Celery
import stemtrace

app = Celery("myapp", broker="redis://localhost:6379/0")

# One line to enable event capture.
# Tip: put this in the module where you define your Celery app so it's imported by
# both Celery workers and any code that calls app.send_task()/delay().
stemtrace.init_worker(app)
```

### 3. View the dashboard

**Option A: Standalone server** (new container/process)

```bash
stemtrace server
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Tip: make sure the server is pointed at the same broker as your workers:

```bash
stemtrace server --broker-url redis://localhost:6379/0
# or:
stemtrace server --broker-url amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//
```

**Option B: Embed in your FastAPI app** (no extra container)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import stemtrace

app = FastAPI(lifespan=my_lifespan)  # Your existing app

stemtrace.init_app(app, broker_url="redis://localhost:6379/0")
```

Access at `/stemtrace/` in your existing app — no new services to deploy.

See [Deployment Options](#deployment-options) for auth, scaling, and more.

## 📦 Architecture

stemtrace is designed as two decoupled components:

### Library (`stemtrace`)
- Hooks into Celery signals
- Captures task lifecycle events
- Sends normalized events to the broker
- **Zero overhead in critical path** — fire-and-forget writes

### Server (`stemtrace server`)
- Reads events from the broker
- Builds task graphs
- Serves the web UI
- **Completely read-only** — safe for production

## 🔧 Configuration

### Library Options

```python
import stemtrace

stemtrace.init_worker(
    app,
    # Optional: override broker URL (defaults to Celery's broker_url)
    transport_url="redis://localhost:6379/0",
    prefix="stemtrace",                        # Key/queue prefix
    ttl=86400,                                 # Event TTL in seconds (default: 24h)

    # Data capture (all enabled by default)
    capture_args=True,                         # Capture task args/kwargs
    capture_result=True,                       # Capture return values

    # Sensitive data scrubbing (Sentry-style)
    scrub_sensitive_data=True,                 # Scrub passwords, API keys, etc.
    additional_sensitive_keys=frozenset({"my_secret"}),  # Add custom keys
    safe_keys=frozenset({"public_key"}),       # Never scrub these keys
)

# Introspection (after init)
stemtrace.is_initialized()   # -> True
stemtrace.get_config()       # -> StemtraceConfig
stemtrace.get_transport()    # -> EventTransport (for testing)
```

#### Sensitive Data Scrubbing

By default, stemtrace scrubs common sensitive keys from task arguments:
- Passwords: `password`, `passwd`, `pwd`, `secret`
- API keys: `api_key`, `apikey`, `token`, `bearer`, `authorization`
- Financial: `credit_card`, `cvv`, `ssn`
- Session: `cookie`, `session`, `csrf`

Scrubbed values appear as `[Filtered]` in the UI.

### Canvas Graph Visualization

`stemtrace` automatically detects and visualizes Celery canvas constructs:

```text
# Parent-spawned group: GROUP is child of parent
batch_processor
└── ┌─ GROUP ──────────┐
    │  ├── add(1, 2)   │
    │  ├── add(3, 4)   │
    │  └── add(5, 6)   │
    └──────────────────┘

# Standalone group: GROUP is a root node
┌─ GROUP ──────────┐
│  ├── add(1, 1)   │
│  ├── add(2, 2)   │
│  └── add(3, 3)   │
└──────────────────┘

# Chord: header tasks inside, callback outside with edges
┌─ CHORD ──────────┐
│  ├── add(10, 10) │──┐
│  ├── add(20, 20) │──┼──► aggregate_results
│  └── add(30, 30) │──┘
└──────────────────┘
```

- **Synthetic containers** — GROUP/CHORD nodes are always created when 2+ tasks share a `group_id`
- **Parent linking** — When spawned from a parent task, the container becomes a child of that parent
- **Chord callbacks** — Rendered outside the container with edges from each header task
- **Timing** — Each node displays start time and duration directly in the graph
- **Aggregate state** — Container shows running/success/failure based on member states

### Environment Variables (Optional)

You **do not need** these environment variables if you’re using the Python APIs:
- `stemtrace.init_worker(app, transport_url=..., prefix=..., ttl=...)`
- `stemtrace.init_app(app, broker_url=..., transport_url=...)`

They exist mainly as **convenient defaults** for:
- `stemtrace server` / `stemtrace consume`
- container/Docker setups where passing flags is awkward

If your app already uses env vars like `BROKER_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, etc., just pass them through:

```python
import os
import stemtrace

stemtrace.init_app(
    app,
    broker_url=os.environ["BROKER_URL"],
    transport_url=os.getenv("STEMTRACE_TRANSPORT_URL") or os.environ["BROKER_URL"],
)
```

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `STEMTRACE_BROKER_URL` | Celery broker URL (used for on-demand worker/registry inspection). Also used as the default for `STEMTRACE_TRANSPORT_URL`. | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |
| `STEMTRACE_TRANSPORT_URL` | Event transport URL (where stemtrace publishes/consumes events).  | Defaults to `STEMTRACE_BROKER_URL`. |

### Supported Brokers

| Broker | URL Scheme | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Redis | `redis://`, `rediss://` | ✅ Supported |
| RabbitMQ | `amqp://`, `amqps://`, `pyamqp://` | ✅ Supported |

### Event Retention & Server Restarts (Important)

stemtrace builds the UI from **events** and keeps state in an **in-memory** graph store.
That means a `stemtrace server` restart starts from an empty store and only becomes “full”
again once events are re-consumed.

- **Redis (Streams)**: On restart, the server can rebuild state by replaying events that are
  still retained in the stream (bounded by `ttl` / stream trimming).
- **RabbitMQ (fanout + per-consumer queue)**:
  - Events already consumed/acked by the server are **gone**.
  - Events published while the server is down are only visible after restart if the server’s
    durable per-consumer queue still exists and the messages are still within TTL.
- **Workers + Registry tabs**: stemtrace uses **Celery inspect** on demand to populate workers
  and registered tasks, so those pages work even if the server missed `worker_ready` events.
- **If you need durable history across restarts**: point stemtrace events at Redis even if your
  Celery broker is RabbitMQ (set `transport_url` in `stemtrace.init_worker(...)` and set
  `STEMTRACE_TRANSPORT_URL` for the server / embedded setup).

## 🐳 Docker

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
    -e STEMTRACE_BROKER_URL=redis://host.docker.internal:6379/0 \
    ghcr.io/iansokolskyi/stemtrace
```

RabbitMQ example:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
    -e STEMTRACE_BROKER_URL=amqp://guest:guest@host.docker.internal:5672// \
    ghcr.io/iansokolskyi/stemtrace
```

RabbitMQ broker + Redis event transport (recommended if you want history across server restarts):

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
    -e STEMTRACE_BROKER_URL=amqp://guest:guest@host.docker.internal:5672// \
    -e STEMTRACE_TRANSPORT_URL=redis://host.docker.internal:6379/0 \
    ghcr.io/iansokolskyi/stemtrace
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  stemtrace:
    image: ghcr.io/iansokolskyi/stemtrace
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - STEMTRACE_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
```

For a local RabbitMQ setup, see [`docker-compose.rabbitmq.yml`](docker-compose.rabbitmq.yml).

## 🖥️ Deployment Options

`stemtrace` offers two deployment modes depending on your needs:

| Mode | Best For | Command |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Standalone Server** | Dedicated monitoring, simple setup | `stemtrace server` |
| **FastAPI Embedded** | Single-app deployment, existing FastAPI apps | `stemtrace.init_app(...)` |

### Option 1: Standalone Server (Recommended)

The simplest way to run stemtrace — a dedicated monitoring service:

```bash
pip install stemtrace

stemtrace server
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the dashboard.

#### Server Options

```bash
stemtrace server \
    --broker-url redis://myredis:6379/0 \
    --transport-url redis://myredis:6379/0 \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8000 \
    --reload  # For development
```

#### Protecting the Server (Built-in Login Page)

```bash
stemtrace server \
    --broker-url redis://myredis:6379/0 \
    --login-username admin \
    --login-password secret \
    --login-secret change-me
```

#### High-Scale Production Setup

Note: `stemtrace server` includes an embedded consumer today (single-process). A multi-process deployment mode is planned.
### Option 2: FastAPI Embedded

Mount stemtrace directly into your existing FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import stemtrace

app = FastAPI(lifespan=my_lifespan)  # Your existing app with lifespan

stemtrace.init_app(app, broker_url="redis://localhost:6379/0")  # Wraps lifespan, adds /stemtrace routes
```

That's it. `init_app()` automatically:
- Wraps your existing lifespan (Sentry, DB connections, etc. keep working)
- Mounts the dashboard at `/stemtrace/`
- Starts the event consumer

Tip: you can also set `transport_url` if you want stemtrace events stored separately from your Celery broker.

#### Configuration Options

```python
import stemtrace

# Returns the underlying StemtraceExtension if you need it (optional).
extension = stemtrace.init_app(
    app,
    broker_url="redis://localhost:6379/0",
    transport_url=None,          # Defaults to broker_url
    prefix="/stemtrace",        # Mount path AND event stream prefix (normalized)
    ttl=86400,                  # Event TTL in seconds
    max_nodes=10000,            # Max nodes in memory
    embedded_consumer=True,     # Run consumer in FastAPI process
    serve_ui=True,              # Serve React dashboard
    auth_dependency=None,       # Optional auth (see below)
)
```

#### With Custom Authentication

```python
from fastapi import Depends
import stemtrace
from your_app.auth import require_admin

stemtrace.init_app(app, broker_url="redis://localhost:6379/0", auth_dependency=Depends(require_admin))
```

#### With Built-in Login Page (Recommended for UI-first)

If you primarily use the UI, the easiest way to protect **UI + assets + API + WebSocket**
is the built-in form login (cookie session):

```python
import stemtrace

stemtrace.init_app(
    app,
    broker_url="redis://localhost:6379/0",
    login_username="admin",
    login_password="secret",
    login_secret="change-me",  # recommended for production
)
```

This serves a sign-in page at `/stemtrace/login` and protects everything under `/stemtrace`.

#### Built-in Auth Helpers (Basic / API key)

```python
import stemtrace

stemtrace.init_app(
    app,
    broker_url="redis://localhost:6379/0",
    auth_dependency=stemtrace.require_basic_auth("admin", "secret"),
)
```

#### Embedded Consumer Modes

| Mode | Use Case | Setup |
|------|----------|-------|
| Embedded | Development, simple apps | Default — consumer runs in FastAPI process |
| External | Production, high scale | Planned |
