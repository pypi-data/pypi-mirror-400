    """
    Score marker genes for each group using a variety of effect sizes from pairwise comparisons between groups.
    This includes Cohen's d, the area under the curve (AUC), the difference in the means (delta-mean) and the difference in the proportion of detected cells (delta-detected).

    Args:
        x:
            A matrix-like object where rows correspond to genes or genomic features and columns correspond to cells. 
            It is typically expected to contain log-expression values, e.g., from :py:func:`~scranpy.normalize_counts`.

        groups: 
            Group assignment for each cell in ``x``.
            This should have length equal to the number of columns in ``x``.

        block:
            Array of length equal to the number of columns of ``x``, containing the block of origin (e.g., batch, sample) for each cell.
            Alternatively ``None``, if all cells are from the same block.

        block_average_policy
            Policy to use for average statistics across blocks.
            This can either be a (weighted) ``mean`` or a ``quantile``.
            Only used if ``block`` is supplied.

        block_weight_policy:
            Policy to use for weighting different blocks when computing the average for each statistic.
            Only used if ``block`` is provided.

        variable_block_weight:
            Parameters for variable block weighting.
            This should be a tuple of length 2 where the first and second values are used as the lower and upper bounds, respectively, for the variable weight calculation.
            Only used if ``block`` is provided and ``block_weight_policy = "variable"``.

        block_quantile
            Probability of the quantile of statistics across blocks. 
            Defaults to 0.5, i.e., the median of per-block statistics.
            Only used if ``block`` is provided and ``block_average_policy ="quantile"``.

        threshold:
            Non-negative value specifying the minimum threshold on the differences in means (i.e., the log-fold change, if ``x`` contains log-expression values).
            This is incorporated into the calculation for Cohen's d and the AUC.

        compute_group_mean:
            Whether to compute the group-wise mean expression for each gene.

        compute_group_detected:
            Whether to compute the group-wise proportion of detected cells for each gene.

        compute_cohens_d:
            Whether to compute Cohen's d, i.e., the ratio of the difference in means to the standard deviation.

        compute_auc:
            Whether to compute the AUC.
            Setting this to ``False`` can improve speed and memory efficiency.

        compute_delta_mean:
            Whether to compute the delta-means, i.e., the log-fold change when ``x`` contains log-expression values.

        compute_delta_detected:
            Whether to compute the delta-detected, i.e., differences in the proportion of cells with detected expression.

        compute_summary_min:
            Whether to compute the minimum as a summary statistic for each effect size.
            Only used if ``all_pairwise = False``.

        compute_summary_mean:
            Whether to compute the mean as a summary statistic for each effect size.
            Only used if ``all.pairwise = False``.

        compute_summary_median:
            Whether to compute the median as a summary statistic for each effect size.
            Only used if ``all_pairwise = False``.

        compute_summary_max:
            Whether to compute the maximum as a summary statistic for each effect size.
            Only used if ``all_pairwise = False``.

        compute_summary_quantiles:
            Probabilities of quantiles to compute as summary statistics for each effect size.
            This should be in [0, 1] and sorted in order of increasing size.
            If ``None``, no quantiles are computed.
            Only used if ``all_pairwise = False``.

        compute_summary_min_rank:
            Whether to compute the mininum rank as a summary statistic for each effect size.
            If ``None``, no quantiles are computed.
            Only used if ``all_pairwise = False``.

        min_rank_limit:
            Maximum value of the min-rank to report.
            Lower values improve memory efficiency at the cost of discarding information about lower-ranked genes.
            Only used if ``all_pairwise = False`` and ``compute_summary_min_rank = True``.

        all_pairwise: 
            Whether to report the full effects for every pairwise comparison between groups.
            Alternatively, an integer scalar indicating the number of top markers to report from each pairwise comparison between groups.
            If ``False``, only summaries are reported.

        num_threads:
            Number of threads to use.

    Returns:
        A :py:class:`~biocutils.NamedList.NamedList` containing various marker statistics for each group.
        This has the following entries:

        - ``nrow``: integer specifying the number of genes in the dataset.
        - ``group_ids``: list containing the identities of the groups.
        - ``means``: double-precision NumPy matrix containing the mean expression for each gene in each group.
          Each row is a gene and each column is a group, ordered as in ``group_ids``.
          Omitted if ``compute_group_means = False``.
        - ``means``: double-precision NumPy matrix containing the proportion of cells with detected expression for each gene in each group.
          Each row is a gene and each column is a group, ordered as in ``group_ids``.
          Omitted if ``compute_group_means = False``.

        If ``all_pairwise = False``, the ``NamedList`` contains the following additional entries:

        - ``cohens_d``: a ``NamedList`` with the same structure as returned by :py:func:`~scranpy.summarized_effects`.
           Briefly, each entry corresponds to a group in ``group_ids`` and is a :py:class:`~biocframe.BiocFrame.BiocFrame` with one row per gene.
           Each column contains a summary statistic of the Cohen's d from pairwise comparisons to all other groups, e.g., min, mean, median, max, min-rank, and any requested quantiles.
           Columns are omitted if the relevant ``compute_summary_*`` option is set to ``False``.
        - ``auc``: Same as ``cohens_d`` but for the AUCs.
        - ``delta_mean``: Same as ``cohens_d`` but for the delta-mean.
        - ``delta_detected``: Same as ``cohens_d`` but for the delta-detected.

        If ``all_pairwise = True``, the ``NamedList`` contains the following addditional entries:

        - ``cohens_d``: a 3-dimensional double-precision NumPy array containing the Cohen's d from each pairwise comparison between groups.
          The extents of the first two dimensions are equal to the number of groups, while the extent of the final dimension is equal to the number of genes.
          Specifically, the entry ``[i, j, k]`` represents Cohen's d from the comparison of group ``j`` over group ``i`` for gene ``k``.
        - ``auc``: Same as ``cohens_d`` but for the AUCs.
        - ``delta_mean``: Same as ``cohens_d`` but for the delta-mean.
        - ``delta_detected``: Same as ``cohens_d`` but for the delta-detected.

        If ``all_pairwise`` is an integer, the ``NamedList`` contains the following additional entries:

        - ``cohens_d``: a ``NamedList`` list of named lists of :py:class:`~biocframe.BiocFrame.BiocFrame` objects.
          The ``BiocFrame`` at ``cohens_d[m][n]`` contains the top markers for the comparison of group ``m`` over group ``n``.
          Each ``BiocFrame`` has the ``index`` and ``effect`` columns, containing the row indices and effect sizes of the top genes, respectively.
        - ``auc``: Same as ``cohens_d`` but for the AUCs.
        - ``delta_mean``: Same as ``cohens_d`` but for the delta-mean.
        - ``delta_detected``: Same as ``cohens_d`` but for the delta-detected.

        Entries will be omitted if the relevant ``compute_*`` option is set to ``False``.
        For example, if ``compute_cohens_d = False``, the output will not contain any ``cohens_d`` entry.
