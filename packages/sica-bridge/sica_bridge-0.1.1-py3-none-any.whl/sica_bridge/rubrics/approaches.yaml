# Note: The following rubrics are only proposed suggestions. The final version should be confirmed by the Engineer.

id: approaches
version: 1
scope:
  component: "Approaches"
  intent: "Post-earthquake access and rideability screening from photos"

r_states:
  R1:
    label: "Open"
    cues:
      - "Approach pavement appears intact; no visible offset, settlement, or cracking that affects access."
      - "No visible obstruction or collapse in the approach area."
  R2:
    label: "Open but inspection needed"
    cues:
      - "Minor cracking/spalling or small unevenness visible but not clearly blocking access."
  R3:
    label: "Close but inspection needed"
    cues:
      - "Visible significant settlement/offset/step at the approach likely affecting vehicle access."
      - "Major cracking or separation suggesting unsafe approach until inspected."

decision_rules:
  - "Classify based on the inspection photo (first image). Reference images are for calibration only."
  - "If any cue for a higher severity is clearly present, choose the higher severity."
  - "If unsure between two adjacent states, choose the more conservative (higher) state."

output:
  requirement: "Return only JSON. Keys: component_id, r_state, reason."
  reason_guidance:
    - "Reason must cite the visible cue(s) from the inspection photo (e.g., 'step offset at pavement joint')."
    - "Do not mention reference images explicitly; use them implicitly to interpret damage."
