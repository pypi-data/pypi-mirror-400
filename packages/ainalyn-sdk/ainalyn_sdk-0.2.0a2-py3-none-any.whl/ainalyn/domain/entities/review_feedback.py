    Severity level of review feedback.

    This enum categorizes feedback from Platform Core's review process,

    Attributes:
        ERROR: A blocking issue that prevents acceptance. Must be fixed
            before the agent can be approved.
        WARNING: A non-blocking issue that should be addressed but does
            not prevent approval. May affect quality or performance.
        INFO: Informational feedback, suggestions, or recommendations
            for improvement. Does not affect approval.

            permission requirements, data handling).

            service violations, restricted content).
        QUALITY: Code quality, documentation, or usability issues.
        PERFORMANCE: Performance concerns (e.g., resource usage,
            inefficient workflows).
        COMPATIBILITY: Compatibility issues with platform standards
            or other agents.
        GENERAL: General feedback that doesn't fit other categories.

class ReviewFeedback:
    """
    Feedback from Platform Core during agent review.

    This immutable value object represents a single piece of feedback
    provided by Platform Core's review and governance process.

    Per Platform Constitution (rule-docs/Platform Vision & System Boundary.md):
    - Platform Core has final authority over agent acceptance
    - Feedback is provided to help developers meet platform standards
    - SDK validation success ≠ Platform Core acceptance

    Attributes:
        category: The category of this feedback (security, quality, etc.).
        severity: The severity level (error, warning, info).
        message: Human-readable description of the issue or suggestion.
        path: Optional JSON Path to the specific location in the agent
            definition where the issue was found. Examples:
            - "workflows[0].nodes[2]"
            - "tools[0].input_schema"
            - "agent.description"
            None if feedback applies to the entire definition.
        code: Optional machine-readable error code for programmatic
            handling. Examples: "SEC001", "QUAL100", "PERF050".

    Example:
