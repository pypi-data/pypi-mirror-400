- Paving the Path to NetZero
NOTES:
Open with urgency: Hydrogen is non-negotiable for decarbonizing sectors like steel, shipping, and aviation. But storage remains the critical barrier. Today, we explore why solid-state storage and AI-driven discovery are game-changers.

# Hard-to-Abate Sectors: The Climate Frontier
- Industry (30% global emissions): Steel, cement, chemicals
- Heavy Transport (12%): Shipping, aviation, long-haul trucks
- Key Fact: These sectors cannot be electrified directly.
NOTES:
Emphasize: Renewables alone can't decarbonize heavy industry or transport. Hydrogen's energy density makes it indispensable. Without it, net-zero fails.

# Hydrogen's Superpower: Versatility
- Clean Fuel: Zero $CO_2$ when burned
- Industrial Feedstock: Replaces coal in steel, gas in ammonia
- Energy Vector: Stores surplus renewable energy
NOTES:
Connect the dots: Hydrogen bridges gaps between renewables and industrial demand. But it's useless if we can't store it efficiently.

# The Storage Bottleneck
Why hydrogen is tricky to handle:
- Low Density: 3x less energy dense than gasoline (volumetric)
- Extreme Conditions: Requires -253°C (liquid) or 700 bar pressure (gas)
- Safety Risks: Leaks, flammability, embrittlement
NOTES:
Contrast with fossil fuels: Storing hydrogen is like trying to bottle smoke—it escapes containment and demands extreme engineering.

# DOE Targets: The Storage Gold Standard
- Gravimetric: 5.5 wt% by 2025
- Volumetric: 40 g/L by 2030
- Cost: USD $< 10$/kWh by 2030
*Current status: $<$4 wt%, \~30 g/L*
NOTES:
Reality check: Today's compressed/liquid $H_2$ falls short. We need a breakthrough to hit these targets.

# Compressed Gas $H_2$: Trade-offs
Pros: Mature tech, fast refueling
Cons:
- 700-bar tanks = heavy/expensive
- 40% energy loss in compression
- Safety concerns
NOTES:
Analogy: Compressing $H_2$ is like inflating a balloon to bursting point—energy-intensive and risky.

# Liquid $H_2$: Cold Truths
Pros: Higher density (70 g/L)
Cons:
- 30\% $H_2$ lost as boil-off in 10 days
- Energy cost: 30\% of $H_2$'s energy content
- Cryogenic hazards
NOTES:
Highlight inefficiency: Boil-off makes liquid $H_2$ impractical for long-term storage. Like ice melting in your hands.

# Solid-State Storage: The Promise
Store $H_2$ in materials like hydrides or MOFs:
- Safer: No high-pressure/cryogenics
- Denser: Potential for $>100$ g/L
- Stable: Ambient-temperature operation
NOTES:
Paint the vision: Imagine hydrogen 'sponges'—safe, compact, and efficient. This is solid-state's edge.
