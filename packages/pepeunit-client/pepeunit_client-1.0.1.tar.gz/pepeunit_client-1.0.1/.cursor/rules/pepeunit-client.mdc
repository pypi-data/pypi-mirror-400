## PRIORITY 1: Core Requirements (MUST follow)
- Follow PyPI Python packaging standards with proper project structure
- PepeunitClient is the ONLY public interface - all other classes are internal
- Implement ALL functionality specified in context/tz.md exactly as described
- Use context/old_client.py as reference for MQTT/REST interaction patterns

## PRIORITY 2: Code Organization (MUST follow)
- Remove unused code: functions, methods, attributes, classes not referenced in codebase
- No redundant implementations - one function per responsibility
- No comments in code - code must be self-documenting
- Use type hints and proper class organization

## PRIORITY 3: Project Constraints (MUST follow)  
- Do not modify: .gitignore, README.md, pyproject.toml structure
- No test files, no example files, no documentation files
- Only create/modify files explicitly required by tz.md specifications

## PRIORITY 4: Implementation Rules (MUST follow)
- Only implement what is explicitly specified in user prompts
- Use Protocol classes for dependency injection (MQTT/REST clients)
- Handle missing dependencies gracefully with standard Python errors
- No print() statements - use proper error handling or logger
