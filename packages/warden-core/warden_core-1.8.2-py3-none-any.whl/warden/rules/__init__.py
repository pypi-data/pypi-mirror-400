"""Warden Rules System - Custom project-specific validation rules.

This module provides project-specific validation rules that complement
AI-powered validation frames. Rules are deterministic (regex/pattern-based)
and enforce company policies, coding conventions, and compliance requirements.

Key Concepts:
- Frames: Generic, AI-powered best practices (SQL injection, XSS)
- Rules: Specific, deterministic company policies (API versioning, Redis key format)
