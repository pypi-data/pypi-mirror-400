            #
            #   - "requests_get": Makes an HTTP GET request.

            #
            # Coded Tools
            #
            #   - "get_current_date_time": Return current date and time for a specified timezone.
            #
            # Each of these tools may require specific arguments in the "args" section.
            # Refer to the tool's documentation for more details.

            # EXTENSIBILITY
            # - Tool registration can be done without modifying core code by specifying the 
            #   tool configuration file (HOCON format) via the AGENT_TOOLBOX_INFO_FILE environment variable
            #   or key "toolbox_info_file" in the agent network hocon file.
            # - The default tool configuration file is located at: 
            #   neuro_san/internals/run_context/langchain/toolbox/toolbox_info.hocon
            #
            #   See https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san/blob/main/docs/toolbox_info_hocon_reference.md
