    "summary": """
        Allows you to use an aditional filestore with AWS S3.
""",
    "description": """
        The basis of the module is to allow the exact same structure of the odoo filestore
        inside an S3 bucket. The default behaviour is always to consider the unavailabily
        of an S3 connection. In all cases it will default to the flesystem. This makes
        migrating from filestore to S3 seamless. Just install as a server wide module or
        even in one only database.

        After the propper key is loaded then the server will start witing new files to S3,
        if available. To migrate just use the aws cli tool and copy all files in filestore
        to the respective bucket, odoo will give priority to S3 bucket.
