           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to the Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Modern ML Pipeline

YAML 설정 기반의 머신러닝 파이프라인 CLI 도구입니다.

코드를 수정하지 않고 **YAML 설정 파일**만으로 모델 학습부터 API 서빙까지 처리합니다.


## 주요 특징

- **설정 기반 (Config-driven)**: YAML만으로 실험을 정의
- **피처 스토어 연동**: Feature Store/Data Lake에 사전 정의된 피처 직접 활용
- **자동 실험 추적**: MLflow와 연동되어 모든 실험 결과와 모델이 자동 저장
- **Data Leakage 방지**: Train/Validation/Test/Calibration 4단계 분할 자동 처리
- **즉시 서빙**: 학습 완료 후 명령어 한 줄로 REST API 서버 기동


## 빠른 시작

### 1. 설치

**요구사항**: Python 3.11 또는 3.12

```bash
# Homebrew Python 사용 시
pipx install --python python3.11 modern-ml-pipeline

# pyenv 사용 시
pipx install --python ~/.pyenv/versions/3.11.10/bin/python modern-ml-pipeline
```

> **설치 전 준비**
> - Python 3.11: `brew install python@3.11` (Homebrew) 또는 `pyenv install 3.11.10` (pyenv)
> - pipx: `brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath` (macOS) 또는 `pip install pipx && pipx ensurepath`

상세 설치 옵션은 [환경 설정 가이드](./docs/user/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md)를 참고하세요.


### 2. 프로젝트 생성

```bash
mmp init my-project
```

생성되는 디렉토리 구조:

```text
my-project/
├── data/           # 학습/추론 데이터 파일
├── configs/        # 환경 설정 파일 (dev.yaml, prod.yaml 등)
├── recipes/        # 실험 레시피 파일
├── sql/            # SQL 쿼리 파일
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```


### 3. 데이터 준비

학습에 사용할 데이터를 준비합니다. CSV 파일 또는 SQL 쿼리 파일을 사용할 수 있습니다.

**경로 규칙**

모든 파일 경로는 **프로젝트 루트 기준 상대 경로**로 지정합니다:

```bash
# 로컬 파일 (프로젝트 루트 기준)
mmp train ... -d data/train.csv        # data/ 디렉토리의 파일
mmp train ... -d sql/query.sql         # sql/ 디렉토리의 파일

# 클라우드 스토리지 (전체 경로 지정)
mmp train ... -d s3://bucket/data/train.csv
mmp train ... -d gs://bucket/data/train.csv
```

클라우드 스토리지 상세 설정은 [환경 설정 가이드](./docs/user/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md#클라우드-스토리지-설정)를 참고하세요.

**데이터 형식 요구사항**

- 각 행은 하나의 샘플을 나타냄
- `entity_columns`: 행을 식별하는 ID 컬럼 (학습에서 자동 제외)
- `target_column`: 예측 대상 컬럼
- 나머지 컬럼: 피처로 사용

Task별 상세 데이터 형식은 [Task 가이드](./docs/user/TASK_GUIDE.md)를 참고하세요.


### 4. 설정 파일 생성

#### Config 파일 (인프라 설정)

```bash
mmp get-config
```

**대화형 인터페이스**를 통해 MLflow, 스토리지, DB 연결 등 인프라 설정을 선택하고 `configs/{env}.yaml` 파일을 생성합니다.

상세 옵션은 [환경 설정 가이드](./docs/user/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md)를 참고하세요.


#### Recipe 파일 (실험 설정)

```bash
mmp get-recipe
```

**대화형 인터페이스**를 통해 Task, 모델, 전처리 등을 선택하고 `recipes/{name}.yaml` 파일을 생성합니다. 생성된 Recipe 파일에서 **데이터 컬럼 정보만 직접 수정**하면 됩니다:

```yaml
# recipes/my-recipe.yaml
task_choice: classification

data:
  data_interface:
    entity_columns: [user_id]      # [필수] 사용자가 직접 지정
    target_column: is_fraud        # [필수] 사용자가 직접 지정
    feature_columns: null          # [선택] null이면 자동 선택

model:
  class_path: xgboost.XGBClassifier  # 대화형에서 선택됨

# preprocessor:                    # [선택] 필요시 추가
#   steps:
#     - type: standard_scaler
```

**필수 수정 항목**

- `entity_columns`: 데이터의 ID 컬럼명
- `target_column`: 예측 대상 컬럼명

**선택 항목** (기본값으로 작동)

- `feature_columns`: 미지정 시 자동 선택
- `preprocessor`: 미지정 시 전처리 없음
- `model.hyperparameters`: 미지정 시 모델 기본값

**참고 문서**

- [Task 가이드](./docs/user/TASK_GUIDE.md): Task별 data_interface 설정, 지원 모델
- [전처리 레퍼런스](./docs/user/PREPROCESSOR_REFERENCE.md): 전처리 옵션 (스케일링, 결측치 처리 등)
- [설정 스키마](./docs/user/SETTINGS_SCHEMA.md): Config/Recipe YAML 전체 스키마


### 5. 학습 실행

```bash
# CSV 파일로 학습
mmp train --config configs/dev.yaml --recipe recipes/my-recipe.yaml --data data/train.csv

# SQL 파일로 학습 (DB에서 직접 데이터 로드)
mmp train --config configs/dev.yaml --recipe recipes/my-recipe.yaml --data sql/train_data.sql
```

SQL 파일 사용 시 Jinja2 템플릿을 지원합니다:

```sql
-- sql/train_data.sql.j2
SELECT user_id, feature_1, feature_2, target
FROM my_table
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '{{ data_interval_start }}' AND '{{ data_interval_end }}'
```

```bash
# 템플릿 파라미터 전달
mmp train -c configs/dev.yaml -r recipes/model.yaml -d sql/train_data.sql.j2 \
  --params '{"data_interval_start": "2025-01-01", "data_interval_end": "2025-01-31"}'
```

**로그 파일**

학습 실행 시 상세 로그가 `logs/` 디렉토리에 자동 저장됩니다:

```text
logs/dev_my-recipe_20250107_123456.log
```

- 파일명 형식: `{환경}_{레시피명}_{타임스탬프}.log`
- 30일 이상 된 로그는 자동 삭제됩니다

명령어 상세 옵션은 [CLI 레퍼런스](./docs/user/CLI_REFERENCE.md)를 참고하세요.


### 6. 추론

학습된 모델로 예측을 수행합니다. 배치 추론과 실시간 API 서빙 두 가지 방식을 지원합니다.

#### 배치 추론

대량의 데이터를 한 번에 예측할 때 사용합니다.

```bash
# CSV 파일로 배치 추론
mmp batch-inference -c configs/dev.yaml --run-id <mlflow_run_id> -d data/test.csv

# SQL 파일로 배치 추론 (Jinja2 템플릿 파라미터 전달)
mmp batch-inference -c configs/dev.yaml --run-id <mlflow_run_id> -d sql/inference_data.sql.j2 \
  --params '{"data_interval_start": "2025-01-01", "data_interval_end": "2025-01-31"}'
```

#### 실시간 API 서빙

REST API 서버를 기동하여 실시간 예측 요청을 처리합니다.

```bash
# API 서버 시작
mmp serve-api --config configs/dev.yaml --run-id <mlflow_run_id>
```

```bash
# API 호출 예시
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"feature_1": 0.5, "feature_2": 100}'
```

#### MLflow 서버 없이 배포

MLflow 서버 연결 없이 로컬 artifact만으로 Docker 배포가 가능합니다.

Config 파일에서 로컬 저장소를 설정합니다:

```yaml
# configs/local.yaml
mlflow:
  tracking_uri: "./mlruns"
  experiment_name: "my-experiment"
```

```bash
# 학습 및 서빙 (Config 설정 사용)
mmp train -c configs/local.yaml -r recipes/model.yaml -d data/train.csv
mmp serve-api -c configs/local.yaml --run-id <run_id>

# Docker 배포 시 mlruns/ 디렉토리 포함
```
