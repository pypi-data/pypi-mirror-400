# worklog

infra:
- run the whole thing from a config file
- ability to initialize from a previous chat?

person gen:
- add a function to generate person configs
- current mood for people (hungry, tired, angry, etc)
- upload context (like from chat groups)

structure:
- develop the message history vs chat history vs memory data model per agent
- DM channel as a personal journal / memory?
- channel metadata serialized. maybe instead of people it should just be the chat workspace metadata.

time:
- should we simulate time at a fixed rate or accelerated rate?
