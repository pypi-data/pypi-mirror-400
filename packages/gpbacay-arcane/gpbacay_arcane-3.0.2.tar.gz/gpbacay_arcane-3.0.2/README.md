## Understanding Neural Resonance

### What is Neural Resonance?

Neural Resonance is A.R.C.A.N.E.'s core innovation - a biologically-inspired training mechanism that mimics how the brain processes information. Unlike traditional feed-forward networks, Neural Resonance introduces a **"Thinking Phase"** where:

1. **Higher layers project feedback** (expectations) downward to lower layers
2. **Lower layers harmonize** their internal states to match those expectations
3. **Multiple resonance cycles** align the entire hierarchy before weight updates

This process mirrors the brain's predictive coding, enabling more stable and biologically-plausible learning.

### Key Features of Neural Resonance

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Prospective Configuration** | Neural activities optimized before weight updates |
| **Bi-directional Feedback** | Higher layers send expectations to lower layers |
| **Temporal Coherence** | Distills temporal dynamics into coherence vectors |
| **Attention Fusion** | Multi-pathway aggregation with self-attention |
| **BCM Metaplasticity** | Adaptive learning thresholds |

### When to Use Neural Resonance

✅ **Best for:**
- Complex reasoning tasks requiring deliberation
- Training stability in deep networks
- Biologically-plausible learning dynamics
- Research applications prioritizing generalization

⚠️ **Trade-offs:**
- Slower training due to resonance cycles (~2x vs traditional methods)
- Higher memory usage for state tracking
- Best suited for medium-sized models
