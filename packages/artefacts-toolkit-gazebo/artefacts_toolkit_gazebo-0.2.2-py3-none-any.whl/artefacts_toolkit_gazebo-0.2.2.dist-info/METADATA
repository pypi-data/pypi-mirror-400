# Artefacts Toolkit Gazebo (Gazebo Helpers)

A part of the Artefacts Toolkit, this package contains helpers to be used when working with Gazebo (Garden and above).

Primarily designed to be used with Artefacts, the package can also be used standalone.

## Prerequisites

* Requires Gazebo
* To create bridge topics, requires ROS2 to be sourced (When using `from artefacts_toolkit.bridge import ...`)
* When using in a virtual environment, you may need to add your site packages to `PYTHONPATH`, e.g.:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<your_workspace>/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages
```
## Usage
```
from artefacts_toolkit_gazebo import gz, bridge
