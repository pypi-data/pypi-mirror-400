Database sessions for web app

The web app uses a different database session than other
(e.g. console) apps.  The web session is "registered" to the HTTP
request/response life cycle (aka. transaction) such that the session
is automatically rolled back on error, and automatically committed if
the response is finalized without error.

.. class:: Session

   Primary database session class for the web app.

   Note that you often do not need to "instantiate" this session, and
   can instead call methods directly on the class::

      from wuttaweb.db import Session

      users = Session.query(model.User).all()

   However in certain cases you may still want/need to instantiate it,
   e.g. when passing a "true/normal" session to other logic.  But you
   can always call instance methods as well::

      from wuttaweb.db import Session
      from some_place import some_func

      session = Session()

      # nb. assuming func does not expect a "web" session per se, pass instance
      some_func(session)

      # nb. these behave the same (instance vs. class method)
      users = session.query(model.User).all()
      users = Session.query(model.User).all()
"""

from sqlalchemy import orm
from zope.sqlalchemy.datamanager import register


Session = orm.scoped_session(orm.sessionmaker())  # pylint: disable=invalid-name

register(Session)
