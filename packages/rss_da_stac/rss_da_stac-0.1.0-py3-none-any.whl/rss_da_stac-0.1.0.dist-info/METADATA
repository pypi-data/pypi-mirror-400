# `rss_da_stac` - Python utilities for interacting with common STAC providers

Remote Sensing Scientists associated with the [JRSRP](https://www.jrsrp.org.au/)
have several established work practices that have been developed over many years,
and predate STAC and cloud-native Earth Observation (EO) data. 

This package is designed To help integrate
their current work approaches with modern data providers via STAC. Of particular
interest is the interoperability of the [`qvf`](https://jrsrp.gitlab.io/sys/meta_info/)
name convention and how that relates to STAC. Several utilities are designed
to work with `qvf` style names, such as 

* `qvf2item`: Convert one or more QVF files to a STAC ItemCollection
* `item2qvf`: Given a stac item or itemcollection, provide the equivalent qvf compliant name for each item. 


see [notes](docs/index.md) for details on the included scripts and the API.
