<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is a 3′-exoribonuclease that removes poly(A) tails from the 3′ end of RNAs. PARN is known to deadenylate some ncRNAs, including hTR, Y RNAs, and some miRNAs and thereby enhance their stability by limiting the access of 3′ to 5′ exonucleases recruited by oligo(A) tails. Several PARN-regulated miRNAs target p53 mRNA, and PARN knockdown leads to an increase of p53 protein levels in human cells. Thus, PARN inhibitors might be used to induce p53 levels in some human tumors and act as a therapeutic strategy to treat cancers caused by repressed p53 protein. Herein, we used computational-based molecular docking and high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify small molecule inhibitors of PARN. Validation with in vitro and cell-based assays, identified 4 compounds, including 3 novel compounds and pyrimidopyrimidin-2-one GNF-7, previously shown to be a Bcr-Abl inhibitor, as PARN inhibitors. These inhibitors can be used as tool compounds and as lead compounds for the development of improved PARN inhibitors.</p><p>Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease that removes poly(A) or oligo(A) tails from the 3′ ends of RNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> . PARN is expressed ubiquitously in almost all tissues of eukaryotic organisms 5 and has multiple functions in eukaryotes. For example, during early development PARN plays a role in mRNA deadenylation in Xenopus <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> .</p><p>In human cells, PARN primarily functions in an adenylation/deadenylation regulatory pathway that regulates the decay rate of ncRNAs (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .

Alternatively, the oligoadenylated tail can be removed by adenosine specific 3′ to 5′ exonucleases such as PARN to maintain stability of ncRNAs. Thus, when PARN is inhibited or defective, some ncRNAs are prematurely degraded, including hTR <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> .</p><p>PARN also stabilizes some miRNAs by removing poly(A) tails added by PAPD5, which prevents the recruitment of exonucleases DIS3L or DIS3L2 to degrade miRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . Importantly, several PARN-regulated miRNAs (miR-380-5p, miR-1285, miR-92, miR-214, miR-485, miR-331, miR-665, miR-3126, and miR-25) either have been shown, or are predicted, to target the TP53 mRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> . p53 is tumor suppressor that prevents outgrowth of aberrant cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair or programmed cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .

Moreover, depletion of PARN upregulates p53 and sensitizes cells to chemotherapeutic agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .

To identify potential inhibitors of PARN, we performed computational-based docking between human PARN and a small molecule library of adenosine analogs and performed high-throughput screening (HTS) of a small molecule library.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purification of PARN for in vitro assay.</head><p>To test the effects of compounds on PARN, we purified the enzyme and developed an in vitro assay for PARN activity. Expression of full-length PARN led to aggregation, but expression of the C-terminal truncated protein (1-430 aa of PARN) was soluble. Previous work has shown that the D28A and F31A mutations in PARN inhibit PARN activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Given this, we expressed and purified the catalytic mutant PARN D28A F31A (PARNmut) as a negative control. Purification (see "Materials and methods") yielded a dominant band for PARN 1-430 and PARNmut on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref>).</p><p>We found that purified PARN 1-430 shows enzymatic activity on the poly(A) tail of test substrates. PARN 1-430 was incubated with a fluorescently labeled RNA with a CCU UUC C sequence followed by a 9 nucleotide-long poly(A) tail and the reaction product was visualized on denaturing acrylamide gels. We observed that PARN removed the 3′ oligo(A) tail from the RNA substrate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> and <ref type="figure">d</ref>). The activity was dependent on PARN since PARNmut protein showed no removal of the 3′ adenosines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). Moreover, we observed that PARN is inhibited when treated with adenosine monophosphate (AMP), as has been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . PARN 1-430 showed reduced activity when incubated with an unadenylated RNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>), consistent with the finding that PARN 1-430 preferentially degrades poly(A) tail <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developing a high-throughput PARN inhibition assay.</head><p>To easily screen compounds for inhibition of PARN activity, we developed an assay in which fluorescence was used as the readout for monitoring PARN 1-430 's activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). This assay was modeled on a similar assay developed for Caf1/CNOT7 deadenylase <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . In this assay, PARN 1-430 was incubated with a 5′-fluorescently labeled oligoadenylated RNA. In the absence of deadenylation, this substrate RNA can effectively hybridize to a complementary DNA oligonucleotide with a quencher on its 3′ end leading to a loss of fluorescence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). When the RNA substrate is deadenylated, the quenching oligonucleotide is no longer able to stably hybridize leading to an increase in fluorescence in the reaction.</p><p>This assay has several features that make it useful for assessing PARN activity. First, it is time-dependent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> and <ref type="figure">d</ref>). Second, it is dependent on PARN concentration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>). Third, we observed that AMP, which is a product of PARN activity and can inhibit PARN 1-430 at high concentrations (&gt; 1 mM), effectively inhibited PARN 1-430 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . Finally, we observed that fluorescence correlates with shortening of the 3′ oligo A tail on the substrate by running the material on a gel and observing shortening of the substrate with PARN 1-430 , but no shortening with PARNmut (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>). In this assay, PARN 1-430 inhibition is inversely proportional to the reaction fluorescence measured as output, which we can use to test possible PARN inhibitors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational-based library docking to identify potential PARN inhibitors.</head><p>To identify potential small molecule PARN inhibitors, we first used a computational-based docking approach to screen a library of 1820 adenosine analogs from the SelleckChem kinase inhibitor library against the crystal structure of the PARN nuclease domain (PDB: 2A1R) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . This library was utilized as the kinase inhibitors are ATP-mimetics and the PARN active site binds adenosine. The PARN nuclease domain includes the four conserved residues among DEDD superfamily, Asp28, Glu30, Asp292, and Asp382, that are important for the catalytic activity of PARN and are required for the binding of divalent metal ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . Mutations of these residues lead to loss of function in PARN <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> . Therefore, based on this information, we targeted this catalytic site of PARN and selected highranking compounds by XP GScore, an approximation of ligand binding free energy, and by interaction with the Asp28-Phe31 region. Analysis of the docking simulation identified several structurally distinct compounds predicted to dock into the PARN catalytic pocket (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Testing compounds predicted to interact with PARN.</head><p>To determine if any of the compounds predicted to dock to PARN showed effects on PARN 1-430 , we tested 15 compounds based on their docking ranks and commercial availability using the fluorescence assay and gels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). This screen identified 7 compounds that showed PARN 1-430 inhibition. GNF-7 (labeled as 5o) has the strongest inhibitory effect on PARN 1-430 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>). In agreement with the fluorescence assay results, the gel assay also revealed GNF-7 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>), a Bcr-Abl inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , as the most effective PARN 1-430 inhibitor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>). GNF-7 inhibits PARN 1-430 with a lower concentration compared to AMP (2.5 mM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref>).</p><p>A dose response curve and kinetic analysis demonstrated that GNF-7 inhibits PARN 1-430 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>). The IC50 of GNF-7 on PARN 1-430 was determined by non-linear fit to be 35 ± 13 μM. This identified GNF-7 as a potential inhibitor of PARN 1-430 based on in vitro analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High throughput screening of Enamine kinase library.</head><p>To identify PARN inhibitors in a highthroughput manner, 24,000 compounds from the Enamine kinase library were tested in a HTS utilizing the  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>. fluorescence assay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). The top 18 compounds with IC50s of less than 10 μM based on testing at different concentrations (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) were then selected for further testing.</p><p>To visualize the inhibitory effects of these compounds on PARN, the reactions were run on gels. We showed all compounds could inhibit PARN at 20 μM, except for TH18 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). This result was consistent with the fluorescence assay, suggesting that these compounds can inhibit PARN in vitro.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Examine inhibitory effects of identified compounds on PARN in cells.</head><p>To test if the compounds identified by docking and HTS affect PARN in cells, we examined the effect of GNF-7, and the compounds from the HTS on RNAs previously known to be affected by PARN activity. Specifically, previous studies showed the levels of telomerase RNA, hTR, and several miRNAs, including miR-21-5p, decreased when PARN is depleted in Hela cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . Therefore, we treated Hela cells with all the compounds (50 µM for GNF-7 and 10 µM for TH1-18) for 2 days and measured the levels of these RNAs using northern blotting and/or RT-qPCR.</p><p>We observed that treatment with GNF-7 reduced miR-21-5p levels to ~ 35% compared to the controls when using northern blotting (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c</ref> and <ref type="figure">d</ref>). Of the compounds from the HTS, TH11, 15, and 16 showed the strongest effects and reduced miR-21-5p levels to ~ 50% compared to the controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7f</ref> and <ref type="figure">g</ref>). These effects were similar to a PARN KD, which reduced miR-21-5p levels to ~ 75% compared with siRNA controls. None of the compounds reduced PARN protein levels in Hela cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref>). Moreover, RT-qPCR was done to examine the changes in hTR levels of the compounds, which confirmed a decrease in levels of hTR with compounds or siPARN treatments, compared to the controls, (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7e</ref> and <ref type="figure">h</ref>). This suggested that GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 treatments can inhibit PARN activity in cells and thereby decrease specific RNA levels. Previous work has shown that PARN inhibition leads to cell death in combination with DNA damaging agent, which has been interpreted to occur through the induction of p53 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . Given this, we examined if GNF-7, TH11, TH15, or TH16 affected cell growth either by themselves or in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin. We observed that at 25 μM GNF-7 and 10 μM of TH11, TH15, and TH16, Hela cells showed growth defects compared to DMSO treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8a</ref> and <ref type="figure">c</ref>). More importantly, we observed that both PARN KD (as previously shown) and cells treated with these compounds showed increased cell death after 24 h of doxorubicin treatment compared to the scramble siRNA and DMSO controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8b</ref> and <ref type="figure">d</ref>). This indicates that GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 increase the sensitivity of cells to the chemotherapeutic agent, possibly through upregulating p53.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Herein, we report the identification of PARN inhibitors in vitro and in cells. PARN was purified and its poly(A) trimming activity was shown to be dose-dependent, which can be measured by a simple fluorescence assay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>). This assay is a useful tool for determining PARN enzymatic activity and for possible drug screen. In computational modeling, we identified several compounds predicted to dock with PARN and tested them using in vitro assays (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Moreover, with HTS, we found multiples PARN inhibitors using the fluorescence assay. These together identified GNF-7, a Bcr-Abl inhibitor, TH11, TH15, and TH16 as compounds that inhibit PARN. GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 were showed to inhibit PARN in a dose-dependent manner with a IC50 of 35 ± 13, 3.36, 2, and 7.9 μM, respectively, which are significantly lower compared to AMP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b-d</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . We also observed these compounds cause phenotypes consistent with PARN inhibition in cells with a reduction in hTR and miR-21-5p RNA levels similar to PARN KD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c-h</ref>).</p><p>The discovery and development of a selective and effective PARN inhibitor could be a useful tool for cancer treatment. PARN is a processive deadenylase and PARN KD has been shown to upregulate p53 protein in cancer cells, which causes cell-cycle arrest and prevents cell growth and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . Thus, targeting PARN may offer a potential therapeutic approach for repressed p53-induced cancers. Previous reports have described aminoglycosides, synthetic nucleotides with fluoro-glucopyranosyl sugar moiety and benzoyl-modified cytosine or adenine, glucopyranosyl analogs bearing uracil, 5-fluorouracil, or thymine as base moiety, and purine-2,6-dione derivatives as possible PARN inhibitors (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), although these compounds required relatively high concentrations and/or have not been shown to inhibit PARN activity in cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> . While some purine-2,6-dione derivatives showed PARN inhibition at relatively low concentrations: 30 μM (5b, 8a-d, and 8f), 10 μM (5j and 5k), and 3 μM (8e and 8j) using a similar fluorescence assay, only five IC50 values were reported with the lowest value of 23.9 ± 3.7 μM (compound 8j) (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . The IC50 of compound 8j is slightly lower than that of GNF-7, suggesting compound 8j may be a good candidate for PARN inhibitor as well. The remainder of these previously identified PARN inhibitors were either tested with a different substrate (poly(A)) or their IC50s were not determined making a direct comparison between the effectiveness of these inhibitors on the activity of PARN difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continued</head><p>From our assays, we identified the pyrimidopyrimidin-2-one GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 as PARN inhibitors. All the compounds are kinase inhibitors. GNF-7 is considered a multi-kinase inhibitor, but it is not a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> . GNF-7 is a potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, ACK1 (activated CDC42 kinase 1), and GCK (germinal center kinase) with IC50s of 133 nM, 25 nM, and 8 nM, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . This is not unexpected since most kinase inhibitors are ATP mimetics; however, our studies support that GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 inhibit PARN activity and could be used as lead compounds for structure-activity study to develop PARN inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity.</p><p>Several observations argue GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 can inhibit PARN in cells. First, these drug treatments of cells decreased the levels of hTR and miR-21-5p (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c-h</ref>), as is seen in PARN-deficient cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Second, we observed that GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 acted similarly to siRNA KD of PARN at increasing cell death in the presence of doxorubicin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8b</ref> and <ref type="figure">d</ref>). Taken together, we propose that GNF-7, TH11, TH15, and TH16 can be used as chemical tools for the inhibition of PARN both in vitro and in cells. However, since these compounds can inhibit a range of kinases, finding additional PARN inhibitors, or developing derivatives of these compounds with more selectivity for PARN is an important future area of future research.</p></div>

Prior to docking, the water molecules were removed, and the proteins were prepared by assigning bond orders, adding hydrogens, and repairing any side chains or missing amino acid sequences. To complete protein preparation a restrained minimization of the protein structure was performed using the default constraint of 0.30 Å RMSD and the OPLS_2005 force field <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> . The prepared protein was subjected to SiteMap analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> , that identified the catalytic binding site and docking grids were generated using Receptor Grid Generation. The compounds in the SelleckChem kinase inhibitor library were prepared using LigPrep by generating possible states at the target pH 7.0 using Epik and minimized by applying the OPLS_2005 force field <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> . Molecular docking simulations were performed using the Glide ligand docking module in XP (extra precision) mode and included post-docking minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> . The docked structures were examined and high-ranked compounds with favorable XP GScores for ligand binding, that displayed interaction with residues Asp28-Phe31, the divalent metal cation binding site within the active site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), were selected for evaluation. The XP GScore is an empirical scoring function that approximates the ligand binding free energy; therefore, a more negative value represents favorable binding.</p><p>High-throughput screening. 2 µL of protein (100 nM final concentration) (stock protein was diluted in 1× lysis buffer (HEPES KOH, pH 7.4, 30 mM, KOAc 100 mM, and Mg(OAc) 2 2 mM) was added to wells using offline Multidrop Combi nL.
