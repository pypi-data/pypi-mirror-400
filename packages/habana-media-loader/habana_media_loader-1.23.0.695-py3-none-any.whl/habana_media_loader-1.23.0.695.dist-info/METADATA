# Habana Media Python package

`habana_media_loader` is a package designed for easy integration of media processing on Gaudi2.
Main entry point (Python import) is `habana_frameworks.mediapipe` module that contains all the necessary functions to work with Gaudi2.

## Structure

Properly built wheel contains:
- `habana_frameworks` python namespace (with all the folder structure inside).
- ``mediapipe`` folder catering media execution on device and ``medialoader`` folder catering pre-built mediapipe for pytorch framework.
- proper licensing.

## Media package (habana_frameworks.mediapipe and habana_frameworks.medialoaders)

#### First part of media package contains media pipe which is responsible for media processing on device.
Following are the steps to create mediapipe
- Create a class derived from ``habana_frameworks.mediapipe`` super class.
- In the class constructor initialize super class.
- Create nodes required for execution along with it's parameters.
- Define a method ``definegraph()`` which defines the data flow between nodes created in constructor.

Following are the steps to execute a standalone mediapipe
- Instantiate an object of defined mediapipe class.
- Build the mediapipe by executing ``build()`` method of mediapipe object.
- Initialize the iterator by calling ``iter_init()`` method of mediapipe object.
- To produce one batch of dataset, execute ``run()`` method of mediapipe object. Each ``run()`` method call executes and produces one batch of device tensors.
- To view or manipulate tensors on host ``as_cpu()`` method of device tensor object can be called, which yields host tensor object.
- For numpy manipulation ``as_nparray()`` method of host tensor object can be called to get a numpy host array.

Example:

```python

from habana_frameworks.mediapipe import fn
from habana_frameworks.mediapipe.mediapipe import MediaPipe
from habana_frameworks.mediapipe.media_types import imgtype as it
from habana_frameworks.mediapipe.media_types import dtype as dt
from habana_frameworks.mediapipe.media_types import layout as lt
import time

class myMediaPipe(MediaPipe):
    def __init__(self, device, queue_depth, batch_size, channel, height, width):
        super(
            myMediaPipe,
            self).__init__(
            device,
            queue_depth,
            batch_size,
            channel,
            height,
            width,
            self.__class__.__name__,
            layout=lt.NHWC)
        mediapipe_seed = int(time.time_ns() % (2**31 - 1))
        # create reader node and setting it's params
        self.input = fn.ReadImageDatasetFromDir(dir="/path/to/jpeg/dir/",
                                                format="JPEG",
                                                shuffle=True,
                                                seed=mediapipe_seed)
        # create decoder node and set it's params
        self.decode = fn.ImageDecoder(output_format=it.RGB_P,
                                      resize=[224, 224])

        # create transpose node and set it's params
        self.transpose = fn.Transpose(permutation=[2, 0, 1, 3], tensorDim=4)

    def definegraph(self):
        # define actual data flow of nodes
        jpegs, data = self.input()
        images = self.decode(jpegs)
        images = self.transpose(images)
        # return output nodes of the graph
        return images, data


# test specific params
batch_size = 4
img_width = 224
img_height = 224
channels = 3
queue_depth = 3
iterations = 5

# instantiating defined class
pipe = myMediaPipe("hpu", queue_depth, batch_size,
                   channels, img_height, img_width)
# build the pipe
pipe.build()
# initialize iterator
pipe.iter_init()

batch_count = 0
while(batch_count < iterations):
    try:
        # exectute and produce one batch of dataset.
        images, labels = pipe.run()
        # images and labels are device tensors.
    except StopIteration:
        print("stop iteration")
        break
    # as cpu will bring the device data to host and produce host tensors
    # as_nparray will convert host tensors to numpy array.
    images = images.as_cpu().as_nparray()
    labels = labels.as_cpu().as_nparray()
    batch_count = batch_count + 1


```

#### Second part of media package contains pre built media pipe for pytorch.


###### torch folder contains media_dataloader_mediapipe containing ``HPUMediaPipe`` which can be used to create resnet and SSD media pipe for pytorch
Following are the steps to use ``HPUMediaPipe`` for pytorch
- Import ``HPUMediaPipe`` from ``habana_frameworks.medialoaders.torch.media_dataloader_mediapipe``
- Instantiate an object of ``HPUMediaPipe`` with following parameters:
    - a_torch_transforms: transforms to be applied on mediapipe.
    - a_root: directory path from which to load the images.
    - a_annotation_file: path from which to load annotation file for SSD.
    - a_batch_size: mediapipe output batch size.
    - a_shuffle: whether images have to be shuffled. <True/False>
    - a_drop_last: whether to drop the last incomplete batch or round up.<True/False>
    - a_prefetch_count: queue depth for media processing.
    - a_num_instances:  number of devices.
    - a_instance_id: instance id of current device.
    - a_model_ssd: whether mediapipe is to be created for SSD. <True/False>
    - a_device: media device to run mediapipe on. <hpu>
- Separate ``HPUMediaPipe`` objects can be created for training and validation.
- Instantiate an object of ``HPUResnetPytorchIterator`` (for resnet) or ``HPUSsdPytorchIterator`` (for SSD) with following parameters
    - mediapipe: media pipe object.

Example for resnet media pipe:

```python
from habana_frameworks.medialoaders.torch.media_dataloader_mediapipe import HPUMediaPipe
from habana_frameworks.mediapipe.plugins.iterator_pytorch import HPUResnetPytorchIterator

normalize = transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                                 std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
torch_transforms = transforms.Compose([
            transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
            transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
            transforms.ToTensor(),
            normalize,
        ])

root = "/JPEG/path"
batch_size = 256
shuffle = True
drop_last = False
prefetch_factor = 3
num_instances = 1
instance_id = 0

pipeline = HPUMediaPipe(a_torch_transforms=torch_transforms, a_root=root, a_batch_size=batch_size,
                        a_shuffle=shuffle, a_drop_last=drop_last, a_prefetch_count=prefetch_factor,
                        a_num_instances=num_instances, a_instance_id=instance_id, a_device="hpu")

iterator = HPUResnetPytorchIterator(mediapipe=pipeline)


```
