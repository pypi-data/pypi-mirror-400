## What You Can Do

**Analyze wellbore stability** in minutes, not days. Calculate stress regimes, mud weight windows, and failure envelopes using industry-standard methods like Eaton and Mohr-Coulomb.

**Classify facies with machine learning**. Train random forest and gradient boosting models on well logs, track experiments with MLflow, and achieve validation accuracies above 90% on Kansas University benchmark data.

**Interpret reservoir quality** using Pickett plots, Buckles plots, and Archie-based saturation calculations. Identify pay zones, water-bearing intervals, and transition zones from log data.

**Pick stratigraphic boundaries** automatically using change-point detection algorithms. Process gamma ray, resistivity, and density logs to identify formation tops with accuracy validated against core and mudlog markers.

**Forecast production decline**. Model hyperbolic, exponential, and harmonic decline curves. Generate P10/P50/P90 type curves and calculate net present value for economic evaluation.

**Import industry-standard formats**. Read LAS, SEG-Y, PPDM, and WITSML files without custom parsers. Export results to CSV, GeoJSON, or your preferred format.

**Model reservoir properties spatially**. Integrate with [pygeomodeling](https://github.com/kylejones200/pygeomodeling) for 3D spatial interpolation of permeability, porosity, and other properties using Gaussian Process Regression and Kriging.

---

## Comprehensive Capabilities

GeoSuite provides everything you need for professional subsurface analysis:

- **Geomechanics**: Calculate overburden stress from density logs, predict pore pressure using sonic velocity, determine horizontal stress bounds, and assess wellbore stability for safe drilling operations.

- **Petrophysics**: Compute water saturation using Archie's equation, create Pickett and Buckles plots for reservoir quality assessment, and analyze neutron-density crossplots for lithology identification.

- **Stratigraphy**: Automatically detect formation boundaries using advanced algorithms, process noisy log data, and generate reliable stratigraphic picks validated against core tops and mudlog markers.

- **Machine Learning**: Train facies classifiers on well log data, validate model performance, and track experiments to understand which approaches work best for your reservoirs.

- **Production Analysis**: Fit decline curve models to production history, forecast ultimate recovery, evaluate project economics, and generate probabilistic type curves for reserves estimation.

- **Spatial Reservoir Modeling**: Convert well log data to 3D spatial coordinates, model reservoir properties using Gaussian Processes, and interpolate properties onto 3D grids. Integrates with [pygeomodeling](https://github.com/kylejones200/pygeomodeling) for advanced spatial modeling.

## Getting Started

### Installation

**Basic Installation:**
```bash
pip install geosuite
```

**With Spatial Modeling (pygeomodeling integration):**
```bash
pip install geosuite[modeling]
```
```

### Your First Analysis

Load sample well data and calculate water saturation:

```python
from geosuite.petro import calculate_water_saturation
from geosuite.data import load_demo_well_logs

# Load sample data
df = load_demo_well_logs()

# Calculate water saturation using Archie equation
sw = calculate_water_saturation(
    resistivity=10.5,  # ohm-m
    porosity=0.25,     # fraction
    rw=0.05           # water resistivity
)

print(f"Water Saturation: {sw:.1%}")
```

Calculate a stress profile for wellbore stability:

```python
from geosuite.geomech import (
    calculate_overburden_stress,
    calculate_pore_pressure_eaton,
    stress_polygon_limits
)

# Calculate vertical stress from density log
sv = calculate_overburden_stress(df['DEPTH'], df['RHOB'])

# Predict pore pressure from sonic velocity
pp = calculate_pore_pressure_eaton(
    depths=df['DEPTH'],
    observed_velocity=df['DTC'],
    overburden=sv
)

# Determine horizontal stress bounds
limits = stress_polygon_limits(sv=45.0, pp=32.0, mu=0.6)
print(f"SHmax range: {limits['shmax_min']:.1f} - {limits['shmax_max']:.1f} MPa")
```

Train a facies classifier:

```python
from geosuite.ml import train_facies_classifier
from geosuite.data import load_facies_training_data

# Load Kansas University benchmark dataset
df = load_facies_training_data()

# Train random forest model
results = train_facies_classifier(
    df,
    feature_cols=['GR', 'NPHI', 'RHOB', 'PE'],
    target_col='Facies',
    model_type='random_forest'
)

print(f"Validation Accuracy: {results['test_accuracy']:.1%}")
```

**Model reservoir properties spatially** (requires `pip install geosuite[modeling]`):

```python
from geosuite.io import load_las_file
from geosuite.petro import calculate_porosity_from_density
from geosuite.modeling import (
    WellLogToSpatial,
    SpatialPropertyModeler,
    SpatialDataConverter
)

# Load well log and calculate properties
las = load_las_file('well.las')
df = las.df()
df['POROSITY'] = calculate_porosity_from_density(df['RHOB'])
df['PERMEABILITY'] = 0.136 * (df['POROSITY'] ** 4.4)

# Convert to spatial format (well at x=1000, y=2000)
converter = WellLogToSpatial()
spatial = converter.convert(df, x=1000, y=2000, z='DEPTH')

# Model permeability spatially using Gaussian Process
modeler = SpatialPropertyModeler(model_type='gpr')
modeler.fit_property(spatial, 'PERMEABILITY')

# Predict on 3D grid
grid = SpatialDataConverter.create_prediction_grid(
    (500, 1500), (1500, 2500), (0, 3000), nx=50, ny=50, nz=20
)
predictions, uncertainty = modeler.predict(grid, return_std=True)
```

## Core Capabilities

### Data Import/Export
Read LAS files, SEG-Y seismic data, PPDM-compliant CSVs, and WITSML XML documents. Export results to industry-standard formats or web-ready GeoJSON.

### Petrophysics
Calculate porosity, permeability, and saturation from well logs. Create Pickett plots for water saturation analysis, Buckles plots for reservoir quality assessment, and neutron-density crossplots for lithology identification.

### Geomechanics
Compute overburden stress, pore pressure, and horizontal stresses. Determine stress regime (normal, reverse, strike-slip) and calculate mud weight windows for wellbore stability. Generate stress polygons to visualize drilling constraints.

### Stratigraphy
Automatically detect formation boundaries in well logs using change-point analysis. Preprocess noisy data with median filtering, apply PELT and Bayesian detection methods, and generate consensus picks validated against core tops and mudlog markers.

### Machine Learning
Train supervised classifiers for facies prediction. Use scikit-learn pipelines with proper well-based cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Track experiments with MLflow, register models, and deploy predictions at scale.

### Production Forecasting
Fit decline curve models (hyperbolic, exponential, harmonic) to historical production. Calculate estimated ultimate recovery (EUR), generate probabilistic type curves, and compute net present value for economic evaluation.

### Visualization
Create publication-quality plots for technical reports and presentations. Generate multi-track log displays, crossplots with isolines, confusion matrices, and decline curves with minimalist, professional styling.
