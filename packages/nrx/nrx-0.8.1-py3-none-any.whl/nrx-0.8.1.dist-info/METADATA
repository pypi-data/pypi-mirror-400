           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# nrx - netreplica exporter

**nrx** reads a network topology graph from [NetBox](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/) DCIM system and exports as one of the following:

* [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev) topology for container-based networking labs
* [Cisco Modeling Labs](https://developer.cisco.com/modeling-labs/) topology for VM-based labs
* Network visualization format for [Graphite](https://github.com/netreplica/graphite) or [D2](https://d2lang.com/)
* Graph data as a JSON file in [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) format [CYJS](http://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/Supported_Network_File_Formats.html#cytoscape-js-json)
* Any other user-defined format using [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templates

It can also read the topology graph previously saved as a CYJS file to convert it into other formats.

This project is in early phase. We're experimenting with the best ways to automate software network lab orchestration. If you have any feedback, questions or suggestions, please reach out to us via the Netreplica Discord server linked above, [#netreplica](https://netdev-community.slack.com/archives/C054GKBC4LB) channel in NetDev Community on Slack, or open a github issue in this repository.

# Capabilities

Data sourcing capabilities:

* Connects to a NetBox instance over an API using a user-provided authentication token
* Exports a network topology graph with Devices that
    * belong to a Site specified with `--site` parameter
    * have a list of Tags specified with `--tags` paramater
* A combination of the two methods above is possible
* Only Devices with Roles from a customizable list will be exported
* Direct connections between Devices via Cables will be exported as topology edges
* Connections via Patch Panels and Circuits will be exported as well with help of NetBox [Cable Tracing API](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/cable/#tracing-cables)
* Only Ethernet connections will be exported
* Device configurations will be rendered and exported if not empty
* As an alternative to sourcing live data from NetBox, imports a graph from a previously exported file in CYJS format

Export capabilities:

* Exports the graph as a Containerlab (Clab) topology definition file in YAML format
* Exports the graph as a Nvidia Air topology definition file in JSON format
* Exports the graph as a Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) topology definition file in YAML format
* Exported device configurations can be used as `startup-config` for Containerlab and CML
* Exports the graph in formats for visualization with Graphite or D2
* User-defined output formats using Jinja2 templates
* Uses NetBox Device Platform `slug` field to identify node templates when rendering the export file
* Customizable mapping between NetBox Platform values and node parameters via `platform_map.yaml` file
* Creates mapping between real interface names and interface names used by the supported lab tools
* Calculates `level` and `rank` values for each node based on Device Role to help visualize the topology
* Exports the graph into CYJS format that can be later converted into a topology definition file, or used by 3rd party software

# Compatibility

The following software versions were tested for compatibility with `nrx`:

* NetBox `v4.1`-`v4.2`. We no longer run tests with previously supported `v3.4-4.0` versions, and underlying [`pynetbox`](https://github.com/netbox-community/pynetbox) library is no longer tested with these older versions.
* Containerlab `v0.39`, but earlier and later versions should work fine
* Nvidia Air API starting with `v9.15.8` (API v2 is used)
* Cisco Modeling Labs `v2.5`
* Netreplica Graphite `v0.4.0`

# Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+. In the commands below we assume you have `python3.10` executable. If it is under a different name, change accordingly.
* PIP

    ```Shell
    curl -sL https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.10 -
    ```

* Virtualenv (recommended)

    ```Shell
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

# How to install

## PyPI package (recommended)

```Shell
mkdir -p ~/.venv
python3.10 -m venv ~/.venv/nrx
source ~/.venv/nrx/bin/activate
pip install nrx
```

## From source code (development)

After running the following commands, you will have a working `nrx` command in the current directory.

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/netreplica/nrx.git --recursive
cd nrx
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to configure

**nrx** accepts the following configuration options, in the order of precedence:

1. [Command-line arguments](#command-line-arguments)
2. [Environmental variables](#environmental-variables)
3. [Configuration file](#configuration-file)

## Command-line arguments

Command-line arguments take the highest priority.

  -a, --api API             netbox API URL
  -s, --site SITE           netbox site to export, cannot be combined with --sites
      --sites SITES         netbox sites to export, for multiple tags use a comma-separated list: site1,site2,site3 (uses OR logic)
  -t, --tags TAGS           netbox tags to export, for multiple tags use a comma-separated list: tag1,tag2,tag3 (uses AND logic)
      --interface-tags TAGS netbox tags to filter interfaces to export, for multiple tags use a comma-separated list: tag1,tag2,tag3 (uses OR logic)
  -n, --name NAME           name of the exported topology (site name or tags by default)
      --noconfigs           disable device configuration export (enabled by default)
  -k, --insecure            allow insecure server connections when using TLS
  -f, --file FILE           file with the network graph to import
  -T, --templates TEMPLATES directory with template files, will be prepended to TEMPLATES_PATH list in the configuration file
  -M, --map MAP             file with platform mappings to node parameters (default: platform_map.yaml in templates folder)
  -D, --dir DIR             save files into directory DIR (topology name is used by default). nested relative and absolute paths are OK

To pass authentication token, use configuration file or environment variable:
export NB_API_TOKEN='replace_with_valid_API_token'
```

Note: for security reasons, there is no argument to pass an API token. Use either an environmental variable or a configuration file.

## Environmental variables

As an alternative to a configuration file, use environmental variables to provide NetBox API connection parameters.

```Shell
# NetBox API URL
export NB_API_URL='https://demo.netbox.dev'
# NetBox API Token
export NB_API_TOKEN='replace_with_valid_API_token'
```

## Configuration file

Use `--config <filename>` argument to specify a configuration file to use. By default, **nrx** uses `$HOME/.nr/nrx.conf` if such file exists. The sample configuration file is provided as [`nrx.conf`](nrx.conf). Detailed information on the configuration options can be found in [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Configuration directory

By default, **nrx** looks up for the following assets in the `$HOME/.nr` directory:

* Configuration file: `nrx.conf`, unless overridden by `--config` argument
* Templates: `templates`, which can be supplemented by additional paths with `--templates` argument

To initialize the configuration directory, run `nrx --init`. This will create the `$HOME/.nr` folder and populate it with a configuration file example and a compatible version of the templates.

# Templates

**nrx** renders all topology artifacts using [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) templates. The user points `nrx` to the set of templates to use with `--templates` parameter.

If `--templates` parameter is not provided, **nrx** will search for Jinja2 files in the `templates` folder in the current directory, as well as in `$HOME/.nr/templates`. You can also provide an alternative list of folders to search via `TEMPLATES_PATH` parameter in the [configuration file](#configuration-file).

Inside the template folders, the required Jinja2 files are taken from a subfolder matching the desired output format. For example, if the output format is `clab` for Containerlab, then templates are taken from `clab` subfolder. For Cisco Modelling Labs `cml` format the subfolder would be `cml`.

A user can create their own templates for any output format and store them in a subfolder with a format name they would use for `--output` argument. To make the new output format available to **nrx**, an entry describing basic properties of the format must be added to `formats.yaml` file in the `templates` folder.

To identify which template to use for each device in the topology, **nrx** uses the `slug` field of the device's **platform** field in NetBox. If a template with a name matching the platform `slug` exists, it would be used by default. Since naming of the platforms is unique for every NetBox deployment, it is not possible to create a generic library of templates that could work out-of-the box for all users. Instead, **nrx** uses a mapping file [`platform_map.yaml`](docs/platform_map.md) to identify which template to use for each platform, with possible additional parameters like value of the `image` tag for Containerlab nodes.

The full list of template search rules:

* `<format>/topology.j2`: template for the final topology file. Mandatory.
* `<format>/nodes/<kind>.j2`: templates for individual node entries in the topology file, with `default.j2` being mandatory as a fallback template.
* `<format>/interface_names/<kind>.j2`: templates for generating emulated interface names used by each `kind` with `default.j2` being a fallback template. Optional, as not all output formats need emulated interface names. For example, not needed for visualization output formats.
* `<format>/interface_maps/<kind>.j2`: templates for mappings between real interface names and emulated interface names used by this NOS `kind`. Optional, as not all `kinds` support such mappings.

The **nrx** repository includes a set of [netreplica/templates](https://github.com/netreplica/templates) as a submodule. See more details about available templates in the [templates/README.md](https://github.com/netreplica/templates).

Although you can always directly customize the templates according to your needs, the platform map file often provides less intrusive way. It should be used if you need to tell `nrx` which templates to use for the Device Platform values in your NetBox system. Also, you can override node images to be used instead of the names specified in the templates, as well as many other node parameters. See [Platform Map](docs/platform_map.md) for details.

# How to use

Start with activating venv environment. See [How to install](#how-to-install) if you didn't install `nrx` yet.

```Shell
source ~/.venv/nrx/bin/activate
```

If this is first time you're running `nrx`, you need to initialize its configuration directory. This will create the `$HOME/.nr` folder and populate it with a configuration file example and a compatible version of the templates. The examples below don't require a configuration file, but do require the templates to be present in the configuration directory.

```Shell
nrx --init
```

## Containerlab example

1. Run `nrx --output clab` to export a topology graph from NetBox in Containerlab format. See [How to configure](#how-to-configure) for details. Here is an example of running `nrx` to export a graph for NetBox Site "DM-Albany" from [NetBox Demo](https://demo.netbox.dev) instance:

    ```Shell
    export NB_API_TOKEN='replace_with_valid_API_token'
    nrx --api https://demo.netbox.dev --templates templates --output clab --dir demo --site DM-Albany
    ```

2. Now you're ready to start the Containerlab topology. Here is the example for "DM-Albany" site

    ```Shell
    sudo -E containerlab deploy -t demo/DM-Albany.clab.yaml --reconfigure
    ```

3. Without `--output clab` argument, `nrx` will save data from NetBox as a CYJS file `<site_name>.cyjs`

    ```Shell
    export NB_API_TOKEN='replace_with_valid_API_token'
    nrx --api https://demo.netbox.dev --site DM-Albany --dir demo
    ```

5. If you have a CYJS file, run `nrx --input cyjs --file <site>.cyjs --output clab` to create a Containerlab topology file from the CYJS graph you exported in the previous step. For example, run:

    ```Shell
    nrx --input cyjs --file demo/DM-Albany.cyjs --templates templates --output clab --dir demo
    ```

## Cisco Modeling Labs example

1. Run `nrx --output cml` to export a topology graph from NetBox in CML format. See [How to configure](#how-to-configure) for details. Here is an example of running `nrx` to export a graph for NetBox Site "DM-Akron" from [NetBox Demo](https://demo.netbox.dev) instance:

    ```Shell
    export NB_API_TOKEN='replace_with_valid_API_token'
    nrx --api https://demo.netbox.dev --templates templates --output cml --dir demo --site DM-Akron
    ```

2. Now you're ready to start the "DM-Akron" topology in CML.

    * Open your CML Dashboard in a browser
    * Choose "IMPORT"
    * Use `DM-Akron.cml.yaml` as a file to import. The import status should be Imported.
    * Choose "GO TO LAB". In SIMULATE menu, choose START LAB
    * Use NODES menu to monitor the status of each node

3. Without `--output cml` argument, `nrx` will save data from NetBox as a CYJS file `<site_name>.cyjs`

    ```Shell
    export NB_API_TOKEN='replace_with_valid_API_token'
    nrx --api https://demo.netbox.dev --dir demo --site DM-Akron
    ```

4. If you have a CYJS file, run `nrx --input cyjs --file <site>.cyjs --output cml` to create a topology file from the CYJS graph you exported in the previous step. For example, run:

    ```Shell
    nrx --input cyjs --file demo/DM-Akron.cyjs --templates templates --output cml --dir demo
    ```

## Topology Visualization with Graphite

A combination of **netreplica** `nrx` and [`graphite`](https://github.com/netreplica/graphite) tools can be used to visualize NetBox topology data. Unlike typical plugin-based visualizers, this method can work with a standard NetBox instance without any plugins installed. You also don't need an administrative access to the NetBox host in order to use this type of visualization.

Follow a two-step process:

1. Export topology data from NetBox in the Graphite format: `nrx -o graphite`. For example, let's export "DM-Akron" site from the [NetBox Demo](https://demo.netbox.dev) instance:

    ```Shell
    export NB_API_TOKEN='replace_with_valid_API_token'
    nrx --api https://demo.netbox.dev --site DM-Akron --templates templates --output graphite
    ```

2. Start Graphite to visualize "DM-Akron" site:

    ```Shell
    TOPOLOGY="$(pwd)/DM-Akron/DM-Akron.graphite.json"
    docker run -d -t --rm \
        --mount type=bind,source="${TOPOLOGY}",target=/htdocs/default/default.json,readonly \
        -p 8080:80 \
        --name graphite \
        netreplica/graphite:latest
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:8080/graphite](http://localhost:8080/graphite) to see the topology. If you're running Graphite on a remote host, or inside a VM, use this helper to show a working URL:

    ```Shell
    docker exec -t -e HOST_CONNECTION="${SSH_CONNECTION}" graphite graphite_motd.sh 8080
    ```

    The visualization should be similar to

    ![DM-Akron Diagram](images/graphite_topology.png)

    To stop Graphite, run

    ```Shell
    docker stop graphite
    ```


If you'd like to be able to switch between multiple exported topologies without restarting Graphite, use one of the methods described in [Graphite documentation](https://github.com/netreplica/graphite/blob/main/docs/DOCKER.md).
