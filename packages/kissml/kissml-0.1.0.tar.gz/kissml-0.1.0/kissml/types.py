class AfterEffect(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for side effects that run after a step completes.

    AfterEffects are executed after a step function returns, whether the result
    was freshly computed or loaded from cache. They enable visualization, logging,
    validation, and other observability patterns without modifying the step's logic.

    Example:
        Create a custom AfterEffect to log DataFrame info:

        >>> import logging
        >>> from typing import Annotated
        >>> from kissml import step, AfterEffect, CacheConfig
        >>>
        >>> class DataFrameLogger(AfterEffect):
        ...     def __call__(self, result, was_cached, func_name, execution_time):
        ...         logging.info(f"{func_name}: {len(result)} rows, cached={was_cached}")
        >>>
        >>> @step(cache=CacheConfig(version=1))
        ... def load_data() -> Annotated[pd.DataFrame, DataFrameLogger()]:
        ...     return pd.read_csv("data.csv")

        The step decorator will automatically execute all AfterEffects in the
        annotation, passing the result and execution metadata.

    Notes:
        - AfterEffects run on both cached and fresh results
        - Multiple effects are executed left-to-right from the annotation
        - Effects should observe results, not transform them
        - The step decorator handles error handling based on configuration
