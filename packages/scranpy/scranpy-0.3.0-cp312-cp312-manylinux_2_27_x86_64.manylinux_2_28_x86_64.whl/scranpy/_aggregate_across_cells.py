    """
    Aggregate expression values across cells based on one or more grouping factors.
    This is primarily used to create pseudo-bulk profiles for each cluster/sample combination.

    Args:
        x: 
            A matrix-like object where rows correspond to genes or genomic features and columns correspond to cells.
            Values are expected to be counts.

        factors:
            One or more grouping factors, see :py:func:`~scranpy.combine_factors`.
            Each entry should be a sequence of length equal to the number of columns in ``x``.

        num_threads:
            Number of threads to use for aggregation.

    Returns:
        A :py:class:`~biocutils.named_list.NamedList` containing the following entries.

        - ``sum``: double-precision NumPy matrix where each row corresponds to a gene and each column corresponds to a unique combination of grouping levels.
          Each matrix entry contains the summed expression across all cells with that combination.
        - ``detected``: integer NumPy matrix where each row corresponds to a gene and each column corresponds to a unique combination of grouping levels.
          Each matrix entry contains the number of cells with detected expression in that combination.
        - ``combinations``: a :py:class:`~biocframe.BiocFrame.BiocFrame` containing all unique combinations of levels across ``factors``. 
          Each column corresponds to an entry of ``factors`` while each row corresponds to a combination.
          Specifically, the ``i``-th combination is defined as the ``i``-th elements of all columns.
          Combinations are in the same order as the columns of :py:attr:`~sum` and :py:attr:`~detected`.
        - ``counts``: an integer NumPy array containing the number of cells associated with each combination in ``combinations``.
        - ``index``: an Integer NumPy array of length equal to the number of cells.
          This specifies the combination ``combinations`` associated with each cell in ``x``.
